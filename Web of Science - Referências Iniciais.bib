Abstract = {Network attack may have a serious impact on network security. With the
   rapid development of quantum machine learning, variational quantum
   neural network (VQNN) has demonstrated quantum advantages in
   classification problems. The intrusion detection system (IDS) based on
   quantum machine learning has higher accuracy and efficiency than the IDS
   based on traditional machine learning. In this work, we propose a
   intrusion detection scheme based on VQNN, which is composed of
   variational quantum circuit (VQC) and classical machine learning (ML)
   strategy. In order to verify the effectiveness of the scheme, we used
   the VQNN model and some classic ML models (Such as artificial neural
   network, support vector machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes,
   decision tree) to conduct comparative experiments. The results indicate
   that the proposed IDS model based on VQNN has a 97.21\% precision, which
   is higher than other classic IDS models. Furthermore, our VQC can be
   deployed on the overwhelming majority of recent noisy intermediate-scale
   quantum machines (such as IBM). This research will contribute to the
   construction of general variational quantum framework and experimental
   design and highlight the potential hopes and challenges of hybrid
   quantum classical learning schemes.},

Abstract = {By combining the advantages of both quantum computing and deep learning,
   quantum neural networks have become popular in recent research. In order
   to collaborate multiple quantum machines with local training data to
   train a global model, quantum federated learning is proposed. However,
   similar to classic federated learning, when communicating with multiple
   machines, quantum federated learning also faces the threats of Byzantine
   attacks. The byzantine attack is a kind of attack in a distributed
   system when some machines upload malicious information instead of the
   honest computational results to the server. In this article, we compare
   the differences of Byzantine problems between classic distributed
   learning and quantum federated learning, and modify the previously
   proposed four kinds of Byzantine tolerant algorithms to the quantum
   version. We conduct simulated experiments to show a similar performance
   of the quantum version with the classic version.},

Abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) has gained immense popularity as a potential
   solution to deal with the ever-increasing size of data and associated
   challenges leveraging the concept of quantum random access memory

   time with quantum parallelism and thus offer a huge leap forward in the
   computation of Machine Learning algorithms. This paper analyzes speed up
   performance of QC when applied to machine learning algorithms, known as
   Quantum Machine Learning (QML). We applied QML methods such as Quantum
   Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to
   detect Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks. Due to the access
   limitations of real quantum computers, the QML methods were implemented
   on open-source quantum simulators such as IBM Qiskit and TensorFlow
   Quantum. We evaluated the performance of QML in terms of processing
   speed and accuracy and finally, compared with its classical
   counterparts. Interestingly, the experimental results differ to the
   speed up promises of QC by demonstrating higher computational time and
   lower accuracy in comparison to the classical approaches for SSC

Abstract = {A classical computer works with ones and zeros, whereas a quantum
   computer uses ones, zeros, and superpositions of ones and zeros, which
   enables quantum computers to perform a vast number of calculations
   simultaneously compared to classical computers. In a cloud-supported
   cyber-physical system environment, running a machine learning
   application in quantum computers is often difficult, due to the existing
   limitations of the current quantum devices. However, with the
   combination of quantum-classical neural networks (NN), complex and
   high-dimensional features can be extracted by the classical NN to a
   reduced but more informative feature space to be processed by the
   existing quantum computers. In this study, we developed a hybrid
   quantum-classical NN to detect an amplitude shift cyberattack on an
   in-vehicle controller area network dataset. We showed that by using the
   hybrid quantum-classical NN, it is possible to achieve an attack
   detection accuracy of 94\%, which is higher than a long short-term
   memory NN (88\%) or quantum NN alone (62\%).},

Title = {Security intrusion detection using quantum machine learning techniques},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VIROLOGY AND HACKING TECHNIQUES},
Abstract = {Conventional machine learning approaches applied for the security
   intrusion detection degrades in case of big data input (10(6) and more
   samples in a dataset). Model training and computing by traditional
   machine learning executed on big data at a common computing environment
   may produce accurate outputs but take a long time, or produce poor
   accuracy by quick training, both disparate to malicious activity. The
   paper observes the quantum machine learning (QMI,) methods overcoming
   the barriers of big data and the computing abilities of common hardware
   for the purpose of high performance intrusion detection. Quantum support
   vector machine (QSVM) and quantum convolution neural network (QCNN) as
   concurrent methods are discussed and evaluated comparing to the
   conventional intrusion detectors running on the traditional computer.
   The QML-based intrusion detection utilizes our own dataset that
   implements the grouping of the network packets into the input streams
   eatable for the QML. We have developed the software solution that
   encodes the network traffic streams ready to the quantum computing.
   Experimental results show the ability of the QML-based intrusion

Abstract = {Quantum artificial intelligence exploits the interplay between
   artificial intelligence and quantum physics: on the one hand, a plethora
   of tools and ideas from artificial intelligence can be adopted to tackle
   intricate quantum problems; on the other hand, quantum computing could
   also bring unprecedented opportunities to enhance, speed up, or innovate
   artificial intelligence. Yet, quantum learning systems, similar to
   classical ones, may also suffer adversarial attacks: adding a tiny
   carefully-crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause
   the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence
   level. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts and ideas of
   classical and quantum adversarial learning, as well as some recent
   advances along this line. First, we introduce the basics of both
   classical and quantum adversarial learning. Through concrete examples,
   involving classifications of phases of two-dimensional Ising model and
   three-dimensional chiral topological insulators, we reveal the
   vulnerability of classical machine learning phases of matter. In
   addition, we demonstrate the vulnerability of quantum classifiers with
   the example of classifying hand-written digit images. We theoretically
   elucidate the celebrated no free lunch theorem from the classical and
   quantum perspectives, and discuss the universality properties of
   adversarial attacks in quantum classifiers. Finally, we discuss the
   possible defense strategies. The study of adversarial learning in
   quantum artificial intelligence uncovers notable potential risks for

Abstract = {Quantum machine learning explores the interplay between machine learning
   and quantum physics, which may lead to unprecedented perspectives for
   both fields. In fact, recent works have shown strong evidence that
   quantum computers could outperform classical computers in solving
   certain notable machine learning tasks. Yet, quantum learning systems
   may also suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding a tiny carefully

   and perturbations for quantum classifiers. Through concrete examples
   involving classifications of real-life images and quantum phases of
   matter, we show that there exist universal adversarial examples that can
   fool a set of different quantum classifiers. We prove that, for a set of
   k classifiers with each receiving input data of n qubits, an O(ln
   {[}k]/2(n)) increase of the perturbation strength is enough to ensure a
   moderate universal adversarial risk. In addition, for a given quantum
   classifier, we show that there exist universal adversarial
   perturbations, which can be added to different legitimate samples to
   make them adversarial examples for the classifier. Our results reveal
   the universality perspective of adversarial attacks for quantum machine
   learning systems, which would be crucial for practical applications of
   both near-term and future quantum technologies in solving machine
   learning problems.
   The existence of universal adversarial examples and perturbations for

Abstract = {State-of-the-art classical neural networks are observed to be vulnerable
   to small crafted adversarial perturbations. A more severe vulnerability
   has been noted for quantum machine learning (QML) models classifying
   Haar-random pure states. This stems from the concentration of measure
   phenomenon, a property of the metric space when sampled

   provide insights into the adversarial robustness of a quantum classifier
   on real-world classification tasks, we focus on the adversarial
   robustness in classifying a subset of encoded states that are smoothly
   generated from a Gaussian latent space. We show that the vulnerability
   of this task is considerably weaker than that of classifying Haar-random
   pure states. In particular, we find only mildly polynomially decreasing
   robustness in the number of qubits, in contrast to the exponentially
   decreasing robustness when classifying Haar-random pure states and
   suggesting that QML models can be useful for real-world classification

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Background Diabetes, the fastest growing health emergency, has created
   several life-threatening challenges to public health globally. It is a
   metabolic disorder and triggers many other chronic diseases such as
   heart attack, diabetic nephropathy, brain strokes, etc. The prime
   objective of this work is to develop a prognosis tool based on the PIMA
   Indian Diabetes dataset that will help medical practitioners in reducing
   the lethality associated with diabetes. Methods Based on the features
   present in the dataset, two prediction models have been proposed by
   employing deep learning (DL) and quantum machine learning (QML)
   techniques. The accuracy has been used to evaluate the prediction
   capability of these developed models. The outlier rejection, filling
   missing values, and normalization have been used to uplift the
   discriminatory performance of these models. Also, the performance of
   these models has been compared against state-of-the-art models. Results
   The performance measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, F-1 score,
   specificity, balanced accuracy, false detection rate, missed detection
   rate, and diagnostic odds ratio have been achieved as 0.90, 0.95, 0.95,
   0.93, 0.95, 0.95, 0.03, 0.02, and 399.00 for DL model respectively,
   However for QML, these measures have been computed as 0.74, 0.86, 0.85,
   0.79, 0.86, 0.86, 0.11, 0.05, and 35.89 respectively. Conclusion The
   proposed DL model has a high diabetes prediction accuracy as compared
   with the developed QML and existing state-of-the-art models. It also
   uplifts the performance by 1.06\% compared to reported work. However,
   the performance of the QML model has been found as satisfactory and
   comparable with existing literature.},

Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Cryptanalysis of quantum cryptographic systems generally involves
   finding optimal adversarial attack strategies on the underlying
   protocols. The core principle of modeling quantum attacks often reduces
   to the ability of the adversary to clone unknown quantum states and to
   extract thereby meaningful secret information. Explicit optimal attack
   strategies typically require high computational resources due to large
   circuit depths or, in many cases, are unknown. Here we introduce
   variational quantum cloning (VarQlone), a cryptanalysis algorithm based
   on quantum machine learning, which allows an adversary to obtain optimal
   approximate cloning strategies with short depth quantum circuits,
   trained using hybrid classical-quantum techniques. The algorithm
   contains operationally meaningful cost functions with theoretical
   guarantees, quantum circuit structure learning and
   gradient-descent-based optimization. Our approach enables the end-to-end
   discovery of hardware-efficient quantum circuits to clone specific
   families of quantum states, which we demonstrate in an implementation on
   the Rigetti Aspen quantum hardware. We connect these results to quantum
   cryptographic primitives and derive explicit attacks facilitated by
   VarQlone. We expect that quantum machine learning will serve as a
   resource for improving attacks on current and future quantum
   cryptographic protocols.},

Abstract = {Adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that focuses on
   studying vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial
   settings and developing techniques accordingly to make learning robust
   to adversarial manipulations. It plays a vital role in various machine
   learning applications and recently has attracted tremendous attention
   across different communities. In this paper, we explore different
   adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We
   find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural
   networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted
   adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical
   or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that
   achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively
   deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible
   perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly
   demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios,
   including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images
   in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as
   ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological
   phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based
   on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical
   defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of

Abstract = {Adversarial attacks represent a serious menace for learning algorithms
   and may compromise the security of future autonomous systems. A theorem
   by Khoury and Hadfield-Menell (KH), provides sufficient conditions to
   guarantee the robustness of active learning algorithms, but comes with a
   caveat: it is crucial to know the smallest distance among the classes of
   the corresponding classification problem. We propose a theoretical
   framework that allows us to think of active learning as sampling the
   most promising new points to be classified, so that the minimum distance
   between classes can be found and the theorem KH used. Additionally, we
   introduce a quantum active learning algorithm that makes use of such
   framework and whose complexity is polylogarithmic in the dimension of
   the space, m, and the size of the initial training data n, provided the
   use of qRAMs; and polynomial in the precision, achieving an exponential
   speedup over the equivalent classical algorithm in n and m.},

Abstract = {High-dimensional quantum systems are vital for quantum technologies and
   are essential in demonstrating practical quantum advantage in quantum
   computing, simulation, and sensing. Since dimensionality grows
   exponentially with the number of qubits, the potential power of noisy
   intermediate-scale quantum devices over classical resources also stems
   from entangled states in high dimensions. An important family of quantum
   protocols that can take advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space is
   classification tasks. These include quantum machine learning algorithms,
   witnesses in quantum information processing, and certain decision
   problems. However, due to counterintuitive geometrical properties
   emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are vulnerable to
   adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of perturbation
   needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification scales inversely
   with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature
   independent of the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore,
   this leads to a tradeoff between the security of the classification
   algorithm against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages that we
   expect for high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these
   adversarial attacks requires extra resources that can even scale
   polynomially with the Hilbert space dimension of the system, which can
   erase any significant quantum advantage that we might expect from a
   quantum protocol. This has wide-ranging implications in the use of both
   near-term and future quantum technologies for classification.},

Abstract = {Quantum machine learning models have the potential to offer speedups and
   better predictive accuracy compared to their classical counterparts.
   However, these quantum algorithms, like their classical counterparts,
   have been shown to also be vulnerable to input perturbations, in
   particular for classification problems. These can arise either from
   noisy implementations or, as a worst-case type of noise, adversarial
   attacks. In order to develop defense mechanisms and to better understand
   the reliability of these algorithms, it is crucial to understand their
   robustness properties in the presence of natural noise sources or
   adversarial manipulation. From the observation that measurements
   involved in quantum classification algorithms are naturally
   probabilistic, we uncover and formalize a fundamental link between
   binary quantum hypothesis testing and provably robust quantum
   classification. This link leads to a tight robustness condition that
   puts constraints on the amount of noise a classifier can tolerate,
   independent of whether the noise source is natural or adversarial. Based
   on this result, we develop practical protocols to optimally certify
   robustness. Finally, since this is a robustness condition against
   worst-case types of noise, our result naturally extends to scenarios
   where the noise source is known. Thus, we also provide a framework to
   study the reliability of quantum classification protocols beyond the
   adversarial, worst-case noise scenarios.},

Abstract = {We propose a novel decentralized feature extraction approach in
   federated learning to address privacy-preservation issues for speech
   recognition. It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network
   (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and
   a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM).
   To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture,
   an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to
   extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features
   are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters.
   The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for
   the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes
   advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid
   privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset,
   the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12\% in a
   decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures
   using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We conduct an
   in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to
   provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural
   saliency analyses demonstrate a high correlation between the proposed
   QCNN features, class activation maps, and the input Mel-spectrogram. We
   provide an implementation(1) for future studies.},
