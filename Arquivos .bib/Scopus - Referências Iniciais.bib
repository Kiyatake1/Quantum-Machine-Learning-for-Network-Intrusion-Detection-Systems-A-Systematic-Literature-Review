abstract={Quantum adversarial machine learning lies at the intersection of quantum computing and adversarial machine learning. As the attainment of quantum supremacy demonstrates, quantum computers have already outpaced classical computers in certain domains (Arute et al. in Nature 574:505–510, 2019 [3]). The study of quantum computation is becoming increasingly relevant in today’s world. A field in which quantum computing may be applied is adversarial machine learning. A step toward better understanding quantum computing applied to adversarial machine learning has been taken recently by Lu et al. (Phys Rev Res 2:1–18, 2020 [13]), who have shown that gradient-based adversarial attacks can be transferred from classical to quantum neural networks. Inspired by Lu et al. (Phys Rev Res 2:1–18, 2020 [13]), we investigate the existence of the transferability of adversarial examples between different neural networks and the implications of that transferability. We find that, when the fast gradient sign attacks, as described by Goodfellow et al. (Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples. arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6572 [9]), is applied to a quantum neural network, the adversarially perturbed images produced with that method have transferability between quantum neural networks and from quantum to classical neural networks. In other words, adversarial images produced to deceive a quantum neural network can also deceive other quantum and classical neural networks. The results demonstrate that there exists transferability of adversarial examples in quantum machine learning. This transferability suggests a similarity in the decision boundaries of the different models, which may be an important subject of future study in quantum machine learning theory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Diabetes, the fastest growing health emergency, has created several life-threatening challenges to public health globally. It is a metabolic disorder and triggers many other chronic diseases such as heart attack, diabetic nephropathy, brain strokes, etc. The prime objective of this work is to develop a prognosis tool based on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset that will help medical practitioners in reducing the lethality associated with diabetes. Methods: Based on the features present in the dataset, two prediction models have been proposed by employing deep learning (DL) and quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. The accuracy has been used to evaluate the prediction capability of these developed models. The outlier rejection, filling missing values, and normalization have been used to uplift the discriminatory performance of these models. Also, the performance of these models has been compared against state-of-the-art models. Results: The performance measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, F1 score, specificity, balanced accuracy, false detection rate, missed detection rate, and diagnostic odds ratio have been achieved as 0.90, 0.95, 0.95, 0.93, 0.95, 0.95, 0.03, 0.02, and 399.00 for DL model respectively, However for QML, these measures have been computed as 0.74, 0.86, 0.85, 0.79, 0.86, 0.86, 0.11, 0.05, and 35.89 respectively. Conclusion: The proposed DL model has a high diabetes prediction accuracy as compared with the developed QML and existing state-of-the-art models. It also uplifts the performance by 1.06% compared to reported work. However, the performance of the QML model has been found as satisfactory and comparable with existing literature. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={We explored the potentials of the quantum machine learning (ML) approach for cybersecurity domain generation algorithm (DGA) detection applications employing two quantum ML approaches: hybrid quantum-classical deep learning (DL) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) models. We implemented quantum noise models and benchmarked the hybrid quantum-classical DL with the VQC-based one. Our datasets include statistical analysis (entropy, relative entropy, information radius, and reputation score) of 1,000,000 Alexa and 803,333 DGA domain names. Qiskit and Pennylane were utilized for the quantum simulations in our experiments. We found that our proposed hybrid quantum DL outperforms the VQC-based model (94.9% maximum accuracy). Investigating the combinations of 12 types of optimizer algorithms, four feature maps, and four variational form circuits reveal that feature maps and variational forms are critical for the VQC algorithm. We show the usefulness of a quantum circuit architecture consisting of Angle Embedding and Random Layers for a hybrid quantum DL model. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Quantum machine learning explores the interplay between machine learning and quantum physics, which may lead to unprecedented perspectives for both fields. In fact, recent works have shown strong evidence that quantum computers could outperform classical computers in solving certain notable machine learning tasks. Yet, quantum learning systems may also suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding a tiny carefully crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. In this paper, we study the universality of adversarial examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers. Through concrete examples involving classifications of real-life images and quantum phases of matter, we show that there exist universal adversarial examples that can fool a set of different quantum classifiers. We prove that, for a set of k classifiers with each receiving input data of n qubits, an O(ln [k]/2n) increase of the perturbation strength is enough to ensure a moderate universal adversarial risk. In addition, for a given quantum classifier, we show that there exist universal adversarial perturbations, which can be added to different legitimate samples to make them adversarial examples for the classifier. Our results reveal the universality perspective of adversarial attacks for quantum machine learning systems, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies in solving machine learning problems. © 2022 The Author(s).},

abstract={It is of great significance to analyze and utilize the massive human, machine, thing and system data contained in industrial Internet to optimize the manufacturing system and service system covering the whole industrial chain and value chain. However, the processing and analysis of industrial Internet big data brings us opportunities at the same time, but also unprecedented privacy concerns. Privacy security is an important part of industrial Internet security. Research on big data analysis algorithms of industrial Internet with privacy protection has been very urgent and severe. Industrial Internet big data processing also has higher requirements for privacy, efficiency and accuracy. We propose a quantum K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm with privacy-protecting characteristics, and find an encryption method for the original training sample set and the sample to be tested, so that the ciphertext sample input to the quantum cloud server can get the same prediction result as the original sample input. In this algorithm, because of the inversion of a prediction result corresponding to N+1 input data, it is difficult to deduce the model, parameters, input data and related attribute characteristics from the prediction results obtained by multiple visits to the quantum cloud server. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can well resist model extraction attack, model reverse attack, member inference attack, attribute inference attack and so on. Compared with the existing quantum machine learning algorithm with privacy protection, it is found that the privacy protection scheme in this paper is superior to the existing schemes in three aspects of privacy, complexity and availability, which achieves privacy protection without increasing additional computing overhead, reducing the efficiency and availability of the algorithm, and affecting the accuracy of the algorithm. We provide a new method to protect the privacy of quantum machine learning and a new idea to improve the comprehensive performance of industrial Internet big data analysis in terms of privacy, efficiency and accuracy, which has important theoretical value and practical significance. © 2022, Science Press.

abstract={Cryptanalysis of quantum cryptographic systems generally involves finding optimal adversarial attack strategies on the underlying protocols. The core principle of modeling quantum attacks often reduces to the ability of the adversary to clone unknown quantum states and to extract thereby meaningful secret information. Explicit optimal attack strategies typically require high computational resources due to large circuit depths or, in many cases, are unknown. Here we introduce variational quantum cloning (VarQlone), a cryptanalysis algorithm based on quantum machine learning, which allows an adversary to obtain optimal approximate cloning strategies with short depth quantum circuits, trained using hybrid classical-quantum techniques. The algorithm contains operationally meaningful cost functions with theoretical guarantees, quantum circuit structure learning and gradient-descent-based optimization. Our approach enables the end-to-end discovery of hardware-efficient quantum circuits to clone specific families of quantum states, which we demonstrate in an implementation on the Rigetti Aspen quantum hardware. We connect these results to quantum cryptographic primitives and derive explicit attacks facilitated by VarQlone. We expect that quantum machine learning will serve as a resource for improving attacks on current and future quantum cryptographic protocols. © 2022 American Physical Society.},

abstract={A classical computer works with ones and zeros, whereas a quantum computer uses ones, zeros, and superpositions of ones and zeros, which enables quantum computers to perform a vast number of calculations simultaneously compared to classical computers. In a cloud-supported cyber-physical system environment, running a machine learning application in quantum computers is often difficult, due to the existing limitations of the current quantum devices. However, with the combination of quantum-classical neural networks (NN), complex and high-dimensional features can be extracted by the classical NN to a reduced but more informative feature space to be processed by the existing quantum computers. In this study, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical NN to detect an amplitude shift cyberattack on an in-vehicle controller area network dataset. We showed that by using the hybrid quantum-classical NN, it is possible to achieve an attack detection accuracy of 94%, which is higher than a long short-term memory NN (88%) or quantum NN alone (62%). © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aims to contribute to the adversarial defense research gap in the current state-of-the-art of adversarial machine learning (ML) attacks and defense. More specifically, it contributes to the metric measurement of the robustness of artificial intelligence (AI)/ML models against adversarial example attacks, which currently remains an open question in the cybersecurity domain and to an even greater extent for quantum computing-based AI/ML applications. We propose a new adversarial robustness measurement approach which measures the statistical properties (such as the average of the accuracies and t-test results) from the performance results of quantum ML model experiments involving various adversarial perturbation coefficients (attack strength) values. We argue that our proposed approach is suitable for practical use in realizing a quantum-safe world because, in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices (NISQs) era, quantum noise is complex and challenging to model and therefore complicates the measurement task or benchmarking. The second contribution of our study is the novel hardened hybrid quantum-classical deep learning (DL) model for botnet domain generation algorithm (DGA) detection, employing a model hardening adversarial training technique for mitigating new types of unknown DGA adversaries since new cyberattack approaches from the cyber arms race need to be anticipated. Our analysis shows the vulnerability of the hybrid quantum DL model to adversarial example attacks by as much as a 19% average drop in accuracy. We also found the superior performance of our hardened model obtained average accuracy gains as high as 5.9%. Furthermore, we found that the hybrid quantum-classical DL approach gives the benefit of suppressing the negative impact of quantum noises on the classifier’s performance. We demonstrated how to apply our proposed measurement approach in evaluating our novel hybrid quantum DL model and highlighted the adversarial robustness of our model against adversarial example attacks as evidence of the practical implication of our study towards advancing the state of quantum adversarial machine learning research for the quantum-safe world. © 2022 Information Processing Society of Japan.},

abstract={Quantum Computing (QC) has gained immense popularity as a potential solution to deal with the ever-increasing size of data and associated challenges leveraging the concept of quantum random access memory (QRAM). QC promises-quadratic or exponential increases in computational time with quantum parallelism and thus offer a huge leap forward in the computation of Machine Learning algorithms. This paper analyzes speed up performance of QC when applied to machine learning algorithms, known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML). We applied QML methods such as Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to detect Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks. Due to the access limitations of real quantum computers, the QML methods were implemented on open-source quantum simulators such as IBM Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum. We evaluated the performance of QML in terms of processing speed and accuracy and finally, compared with its classical counterparts. Interestingly, the experimental results differ to the speed up promises of QC by demonstrating higher computational time and lower accuracy in comparison to the classical approaches for SSC attacks. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are amongst the most important automated defense mechanisms in modern industry. It is guarding against many attack vectors, especially in healthcare, where sensitive information (patient&#x2019;s medical history, prescriptions, electronic health records, medical bills/debts, and many other sensitive data points) is open to compromise from adversaries. In the big data era, classical machine learning has been applied to train IDS. However, classical IDS tend to be complex: either using several hidden layers susceptible to over-fitting on training data or using overly complex architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long-short term memory systems (LSTMs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This paper explored the combination of principles of quantum mechanics and neural networks to train IDS. A hybrid classical-quantum neural architecture is proposed with a quantum-assisted activation function that successfully captures patterns in the dataset while having less architectural memory footprint than classical solutions. The experimental results are demonstrated on the popular KDD99 dataset while comparing our solution to other classical models. IEEE},

abstract={Since actions taken as a result of inaccurate fault classification can have catastrophic implications, fault and malware categorization must be accurate for control systems within Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Additionally, adversarial attacks on the control systems used in Industrial control can result in losses to the operating plant. We propose to monitor the control processors through an analysis of the electromagnetic emanations. A hybrid deep-learning model with quantum and classical layers is explored for developing high-accuracy classification models for control system fault analysis. Our objective is to investigate a hybrid deep-learning architecture for classical-quantum transfer learning models with the goal of increasing the accuracy of Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum domain-based control system processor fault analysis. On these hybrid models, we evaluate the impact of faults and adversarial attacks. The core component of hybrid models is a neural network trained on a dataset for the purpose of extracting relevant features from a high-dimensional Electromagnetic (EM) trace-based fault dataset. The quantum layer subsequently analyses the result of the conventional deep learning process. The quantum layer is composed of several quantum gates and is capable of supporting a variety of quantum mechanical operations, including superposition and entanglement. We examined several combinations of quantum circuits to improve accuracy of classification and found that our hybrid classical-quantum deep learning model is more accurate at detecting flaws and attacks over classical convolutional neural network machine learning models. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial control systems rely on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for the communication with sensors and actuators. On the other hand, vulnerabilities in Ladder logic and in turn PLCs being vulnerable to malware written in ladder logic or any other IEC 61131-3-compliant language is a new far more dangerous challenge in industrial control systems. Attackers install malware into a PLC's existing control logic to either modify the behavior continuously or wait for specific triggers. We consider Ladder Logic Bombs (LLBs) which are an extension of attacks like Stuxnet. These include stealthy LLBs, which are difficult to discover by humans manually evaluating PLC programs. We propose a monitoring technology for PLC's via Hybrid Quantum-Classical modelling of electromagnetic emissions from the Programmable Logic Controllers even in the case of stealthy LLBs. Our goal is to discover Ladder logic bombs from typical faults utilizing Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum domain-based control system processor fault analysis. We investigated various different types of ladder logic bomb activation, triggering modes, and payloads and discovered that our hybrid classical-quantum deep learning model can operate decoupled from the network and is very accurate at detecting logic layer vulnerabilities and faults. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Conventional machine learning approaches applied for the security intrusion detection degrades in case of big data input (10 6 and more samples in a dataset). Model training and computing by traditional machine learning executed on big data at a common computing environment may produce accurate outputs but take a long time, or produce poor accuracy by quick training, both disparate to malicious activity. The paper observes the quantum machine learning (QML) methods overcoming the barriers of big data and the computing abilities of common hardware for the purpose of high performance intrusion detection. Quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and quantum convolution neural network (QCNN) as concurrent methods are discussed and evaluated comparing to the conventional intrusion detectors running on the traditional computer. The QML-based intrusion detection utilizes our own dataset that implements the grouping of the network packets into the input streams eatable for the QML. We have developed the software solution that encodes the network traffic streams ready to the quantum computing. Experimental results show the ability of the QML-based intrusion detection for processing big data inputs with high accuracy (98%) providing a twice faster speed comparing to the conventional machine learning algorithms utilized for the same task. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Network attack may have a serious impact on network security. With the rapid development of quantum machine learning, variational quantum neural network (VQNN) has demonstrated quantum advantages in classification problems. The intrusion detection system (IDS) based on quantum machine learning has higher accuracy and efficiency than the IDS based on traditional machine learning. In this work, we propose a intrusion detection scheme based on VQNN, which is composed of variational quantum circuit (VQC) and classical machine learning (ML) strategy. In order to verify the effectiveness of the scheme, we used the VQNN model and some classic ML models (Such as artificial neural network, support vector machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, decision tree) to conduct comparative experiments. The results indicate that the proposed IDS model based on VQNN has a 97.21% precision, which is higher than other classic IDS models. Furthermore, our VQC can be deployed on the overwhelming majority of recent noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines (such as IBM). This research will contribute to the construction of general variational quantum framework and experimental design and highlight the potential hopes and challenges of hybrid quantum classical learning schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={We provide a robust defence to adversarial attacks on discriminative algorithms. Neural networks are naturally vulnerable to small, tailored perturbations in the input data that lead to wrong predictions. On the contrary, generative models attempt to learn the distribution underlying a dataset, making them inherently more robust to small perturbations. We use Boltzmann machines for discrimination purposes as attack-resistant classifiers, and compare them against standard state-of-the-art adversarial defences. We find improvements ranging from 5% to 72% against attacks with Boltzmann machines on the MNIST dataset. We furthermore complement the training with quantum-enhanced sampling from the D-Wave 2000Q annealer, finding results comparable with classical techniques and with marginal improvements in some cases. These results underline the relevance of probabilistic methods in constructing neural networks and highlight a novel scenario of practical relevance where quantum computers, even with limited hardware capabilities, could provide advantages over classical computers. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={Quantum machine learning models have the potential to offer speedups and better predictive accuracy compared to their classical counterparts. However, these quantum algorithms, like their classical counterparts, have been shown to also be vulnerable to input perturbations, in particular for classification problems. These can arise either from noisy implementations or, as a worst-case type of noise, adversarial attacks. In order to develop defense mechanisms and to better understand the reliability of these algorithms, it is crucial to understand their robustness properties in the presence of natural noise sources or adversarial manipulation. From the observation that measurements involved in quantum classification algorithms are naturally probabilistic, we uncover and formalize a fundamental link between binary quantum hypothesis testing and provably robust quantum classification. This link leads to a tight robustness condition that puts constraints on the amount of noise a classifier can tolerate, independent of whether the noise source is natural or adversarial. Based on this result, we develop practical protocols to optimally certify robustness. Finally, since this is a robustness condition against worst-case types of noise, our result naturally extends to scenarios where the noise source is known. Thus, we also provide a framework to study the reliability of quantum classification protocols beyond the adversarial, worst-case noise scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Over the past decade, an infotelecommunication technology has made significant strides forward. With the advent of new generation wireless networks and the massive digitalization of industries, the object of protection has changed. The digital transformation has led to an increased opportunity for cybercriminals. The ability of computational intelligence to quickly process large amounts of data makes the intrusions tailored to specific environments. Polymorphic attacks that have mutations in their sequences of acts adapt to the communication environments, operating systems and service frameworks, and also try to deceive the defense tools. The poor protection of most Internet of Things devices allows the attackers to take control over them creating the megabotnets. In this regard, traditional methods of network protection become rigid and low-effective. The paper reviews a computational intelligence (CI) enabled software- defined network (SDN) for the network management, providing dynamic network reconfiguration to improve network performance and security control. Advanced machine learning and artificial neural networks are promising in detection of false data injections. Bioinformatics methods make it possible to detect polymorphic attacks. Swarm intelligence detects dynamic routing anomalies. Quantum machine learning is effective at processing the large volumes of security-relevant datasets. The CI technology stack provides a comprehensive protection against a variative cyberthreats scope. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Quantum artificial intelligence exploits the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum physics: on the one hand, a plethora of tools and ideas from artificial intelligence can be adopted to tackle intricate quantum problems; on the other hand, quantum computing could also bring unprecedented opportunities to enhance, speed up, or innovate artificial intelligence. Yet, quantum learning systems, similar to classical ones, may also suffer adversarial attacks: adding a tiny carefully-crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts and ideas of classical and quantum adversarial learning, as well as some recent advances along this line. First, we introduce the basics of both classical and quantum adversarial learning. Through concrete examples, involving classifications of phases of two-dimensional Ising model and three-dimensional chiral topological insulators, we reveal the vulnerability of classical machine learning phases of matter. In addition, we demonstrate the vulnerability of quantum classifiers with the example of classifying hand-written digit images. We theoretically elucidate the celebrated no free lunch theorem from the classical and quantum perspectives, and discuss the universality properties of adversarial attacks in quantum classifiers. Finally, we discuss the possible defense strategies. The study of adversarial learning in quantum artificial intelligence uncovers notable potential risks for quantum intelligence systems, which would have far-reaching consequences for the future interactions between the two areas. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society.},

abstract={State-of-the-art classical neural networks are observed to be vulnerable to small crafted adversarial perturbations. A more severe vulnerability has been noted for quantum machine learning (QML) models classifying Haar-random pure states. This stems from the concentration of measure phenomenon, a property of the metric space when sampled probabilistically, and is independent of the classification protocol. To provide insights into the adversarial robustness of a quantum classifier on real-world classification tasks, we focus on the adversarial robustness in classifying a subset of encoded states that are smoothly generated from a Gaussian latent space. We show that the vulnerability of this task is considerably weaker than that of classifying Haar-random pure states. In particular, we find only mildly polynomially decreasing robustness in the number of qubits, in contrast to the exponentially decreasing robustness when classifying Haar-random pure states and suggesting that QML models can be useful for real-world classification tasks. © 2021 American Physical Society.},

abstract={By combining the advantages of both quantum computing and deep learning, quantum neural networks have become popular in recent research. In order to collaborate multiple quantum machines with local training data to train a global model, quantum federated learning is proposed. However, similar to classic federated learning, when communicating with multiple machines, quantum federated learning also faces the threats of Byzantine attacks. The byzantine attack is a kind of attack in a distributed system when some machines upload malicious information instead of the honest computational results to the server. In this article, we compare the differences of Byzantine problems between classic distributed learning and quantum federated learning, and modify the previously proposed four kinds of Byzantine tolerant algorithms to the quantum version. We conduct simulated experiments to show a similar performance of the quantum version with the classic version. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have potentials for current quantum computing technologies since only part of the model is computed by a quantum device. This paper proposes a novel hybrid quantum-classical deep learning model for cybersecurity application: domain generation algorithms (DGA)-based botnet detection. We analyzed our hybrid model's performance compared with the classical model counterpart to investigate the quantum circuit's effectivity as a layer in a deep learning model. We used four features of the Botnet DGA dataset: MinREBotnets, CharLength, TreeNewFeature, and nGramReputation_Alexa. The hybrid model's quantum circuit is a combination of Pennylane's embedding (Angle Embedding and IQP Embedding) and layers circuit (Basic Entangler Layers, Random Layers, and Strongly Entangling Layers). Also, we implemented noise models for assessing the applicability of the model for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology. We found that in some cases, the hybrid model reached high performance (maximum accuracy up to 94,7% using n=100; 93,9% using n=1,000). We discovered that the combination of Angle Embedding and Strongly Entangled delivers high accuracy, superior to the classical deep learning model in n=100 experiments). However, the overall performance is still inferior for the rest cases compared to the classical deep learning model counterpart. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We propose a novel decentralized feature extraction approach in federated learning to address privacy-preservation issues for speech recognition. It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We conduct an in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses demonstrate a high correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation maps, and the input Mel-spectrogram. We provide an implementation1 for future studies. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the limitations of hardware, the development of universal quantum computer devices is slow. At present, the maximum integer factorization by general Shor's algorithm is 85 (using the characteristics of Fermat numbers to factor the integer 85 with 8 qubits), which is not a threat to the practical 1024-bit RSA by Shor's algorithm. Since the universal quantum computer cannot be practical in a short time, the modern cryptography is still secure enough now. Quantum computing cryptography attack needs to explore new ways to enhance its quantum attacking ability: Firstly, whether quantum computing can assist/accelerate traditional cryptography attack mode and expand its more powerful quantum attacking ability on the basis of the existing quantum computing. Secondly, it is necessary to find quantum computing algorithms other than Shor's algorithm to explore quantum computing cryptographic attack. In this paper, various existing algorithms for integer factorization algorithms of quantum computing are studied and show optimistic potentials of quantum annealing algorithm and D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem. Such as Shor's algorithm (factor up to 85) via different platforms (like Hua-Wei quantum computing platform), quantum adiabatic computation via NMR (291311), D-Wave (purchased by Lockheed Martin and Google etc., has been initially used for image processing, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and software verification etc.) quantum computer (factored up to 376289), quantum computing software environment provided by D-Wave (factor the integer 1001677 with 87 qubits) to obtain a higher success rate and extend it to a larger factorization scale. Actually, D-Wave using quantum annealing may be closer to cracking practical RSA codes than a general-purpose quantum computer (IBM) using Shor's algorithm. In addition, the model limitations and precision problems existing in the expansion of integer factorization to a larger scale are discussed. Majorities of scholars think Shor's algorithm as the unique and powerful quantum algorithm for cryptanalysis of RSA. Therefore, the current state of post-quantum cryptography research exclusively referred to potential threatens of Shor's algorithm. This paper analyzes the RSA deciphering method based on D-Wave quantum annealing principle, which is a new public key cryptography attack algorithm for quantum computing, and it is fundamentally different from Shor's algorithm in principle. It is the second effective quantum attack method (RSA deciphering) in addition to Shor's algorithm. Thus, the post-quantum cryptography research should further consider the potentials of D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem in future. Furthermore, Grover's quantum searching algorithm is applied to the elliptic curve side channel attack to expand its attack capability. It is a new effective public key cryptosystem attack method, which is helpful to expand the attack of quantum computing on other public key cryptosystem constitutions. Finally, the possibility of quantum artificial intelligence algorithm attacking NTRU and other post-quantum cryptography is discussed. It is necessary to explore a new cryptographic scheme that can resist the attack of quantum computing, and combine evolutionary cryptography with quantum artificial intelligence, which is expected to be applied to the design and analysis of cryptography algorithms in the post-quantum cryptography. © 2020, Science Press.

abstract={Adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that focuses on studying vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and developing techniques accordingly to make learning robust to adversarial manipulations. It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications and recently has attracted tremendous attention across different communities. In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals another perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies. © 2020 authors.

abstract={Quantum information processing is a rapidly growing industry with promising results in the near future. Its implementtation has serious impact on almost any areas of our lives: Cyber-security, communication, AI, etc. Any computations can be considered as quantum ones and in this context classical computations are a subset of quantum computations. One of the most promising applications of quantum technologies is the AI, in particular, machine learning. The intriguing question in quantum machine learning is whether there are problems in machine learning and AI that fit quantum computers naturally, but are challenging on classical hardware. In this paper we research discrete optimization problem and ensemble learning in the context of pattern recognition problems. In particular, we are considering a person identification problem based on an image of his face using the ensemble learning method and approaches to the optimization problems in the context of a training of machine learning models. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Adversarial attacks represent a serious menace for learning algorithms and may compromise the security of future autonomous systems. A theorem by Khoury and Hadfield-Menell (KH), provides sufficient conditions to guarantee the robustness of active learning algorithms, but comes with a caveat: it is crucial to know the smallest distance among the classes of the corresponding classification problem. We propose a theoretical framework that allows us to think of active learning as sampling the most promising new points to be classified, so that the minimum distance between classes can be found and the theorem KH used. Additionally, we introduce a quantum active learning algorithm that makes use of such framework and whose complexity is polylogarithmic in the dimension of the space, m, and the size of the initial training data n, provided the use of qRAMs; and polynomial in the precision, achieving an exponential speedup over the equivalent classical algorithm in n and m. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={High-dimensional quantum systems are vital for quantum technologies and are essential in demonstrating practical quantum advantage in quantum computing, simulation, and sensing. Since dimensionality grows exponentially with the number of qubits, the potential power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices over classical resources also stems from entangled states in high dimensions. An important family of quantum protocols that can take advantage of high-dimensional Hilbert space is classification tasks. These include quantum machine learning algorithms, witnesses in quantum information processing, and certain decision problems. However, due to counterintuitive geometrical properties emergent in high dimensions, classification problems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that the amount of perturbation needed for an adversary to induce a misclassification scales inversely with dimensionality. This is shown to be a fundamental feature independent of the details of the classification protocol. Furthermore, this leads to a tradeoff between the security of the classification algorithm against adversarial attacks and quantum advantages that we expect for high-dimensional problems. In fact, protection against these adversarial attacks requires extra resources that can even scale polynomially with the Hilbert space dimension of the system, which can erase any significant quantum advantage that we might expect from a quantum protocol. This has wide-ranging implications in the use of both near-term and future quantum technologies for classification. © 2020 American Physical Society},

abstract={How to use artificial intelligence to design high-intensity cryptography and make crypto-graphy design automation is a long-term goal. Chinese scholars combine cryptography with evolutionary computing, independently put forward the concept of evolutionary cryptography and evolutionary computing method for cryptography design based on the idea of biological evolution, to obtain variable gradual cryptography that reduces the magnitude of search space required for attacks. Research shows that evolutionary cryptography has achieved practical results in symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, side channel attacks, and post-quantum cryptography: more than one hundred good S-boxes (8×8) can be designed in one minute, and some of the cryptography indexes reach the best value. For typical post-quantum cryptography NTRU, evolutionary cryptography attacks are expected to reduce the key search space by 2~3 orders of magnitude. ECC security curve produces a base range that exceeds the curve published by NIST, and new curves have been found in the range of curve published by NIST. Evolution cryptography has some characteristics of artificial intelligence cryptography. Further combining with quantum artificial intelligence, it has not only obtained the best index of quantum computing for deciphering RSA, but also exceeded the theoretical maximum of IBM Q System OneTM with Shor's algorithm and the maximum scale of Lockheed Martin with quantum annealing to decipher RSA. In addition, the original research on the cryptography design was proposed, and the original research on the cryptography design based on D-Wave 2000Q systems was completed, which is expected to quickly produce a series of suboptimal solutions, achieve the function of one-time one encryption algorithm, enhance the security of cryptography system. © 2019, Science Press.

An attack description method based on evidence chain is proposed, and the key fingerprints of each link of the network attack chain are summarized. Furthermore, the corresponding model for identification of the homology of network attacks is proposed. The edit distance between each link is calculated to describe the similarity, and the algorithm fusion of similarity is designed by neural network method. Then, the homologous decision of network attack is recognized. It shows that this method can effectively determine the homology of network attacks, with more accurate result over the sample-based method.
