In order to collaborate multiple quantum machines with local training data to train a global model, quantum federated learning is proposed. However, similar to classic federated learning, when communicating with multiple machines, quantum federated learning also faces the threats of Byzantine attacks. The byzantine attack is a kind of attack in a distributed system when some machines upload malicious information instead of the honest computational results to the server. In this article, we compare the differences of Byzantine problems between classic distributed learning and quantum federated learning, and modify the previously proposed four kinds of Byzantine tolerant algorithms to the quantum version. We conduct simulated experiments to show a similar performance of the quantum version with the classic version.},

This paper analyzes speed up performance of QC when applied to machine learning algorithms, known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML). We applied QML methods such as Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to detect Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks. Due to the access limitations of real quantum computers, the QML methods were implemented on open-source quantum simulators such as IBM Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum. We evaluated the performance of QML in terms of processing speed and accuracy and finally, compared with its classical counterparts. Interestingly, the experimental results differ to the speed up promises of QC by demonstrating higher computational time and lower accuracy in comparison to the classical approaches for SSC attacks.},

These challenges are more serious in the quantum communications era, where certain attackers might have quantum computing capabilities, which renders IoT devices more vulnerable. This paper addresses the problem of IoT security by investigating quantum key distribution (QKD) in beyond 5G networks. An algorithm for detecting an attacker between a transmitter and receiver is proposed, with the side effect of interrupting the QKD process while detecting the attacker. Afterwards, Artificial neural network (ANN) and deep learning (DL) techniques are proposed in order to detect the presence of an attacker during QKD without the need to disrupt the key distribution process. An architecture for implementing QKD in beyond 5G IoT networks is proposed, offloading the heavy computational tasks to IoT controllers. In addition, an implementation scenario for securing IoT communications for sensors deployed in railroad networks is described. The results show that the proposed ML techniques can reach 99% accuracy in detecting attackers.},

Through these, attackers that may be oblivious to the precise mechanics of the targeted NIDS add subtle perturbations to malicious traffic features, with the aim of evading detection and disrupting critical systems. Defending against such adversarial attacks is of high importance, but requires to address daunting challenges. Here, we introduce TIKI- TAKA, a general framework for (i) assessing the robustness of state-of-the-art deep learning-based NIDS against adversarial manipulations, and which (ii) incorporates defense mechanisms that we propose to increase resistance to attacks employing such evasion techniques. Specifically, we select five cutting-edge adversarial attack types to subvert three popular malicious traffic detectors that employ NNs. We experiment with publicly available datasets and consider both one-to-all and one-to-one classification scenarios, i.e., discriminating illicit vs benign traffic and respectively identifying specific types of anomalous traffic among many observed. The results obtained reveal that attackers can evade NIDS with up to 35.7% success rates, by only altering time-based features of the traffic generated. To counteract these weaknesses, we propose three defense mechanisms: model voting ensembling, ensembling adversarial training, and query detection. We demonstrate that these methods can restore intrusion detection rates to nearly 100% against most types of malicious traffic, and attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences (e.g., botnet) can be thwarted. This confirms the effectiveness of our solutions and makes the case for their adoption when designing robust and reliable deep anomaly detectors.},

Lattice-based key exchange protocols show strong promise due to their resistance to theoretical quantum-cryptanalysis and low implementation overhead.

The state-of-the-art SCAs are, however, limited to simple, sequentialized executions of post-quantum key-exchange (PQKE) protocols, leaving the vulnerability of complex, parallelized architectures unknown. This article proposes 2Deep-a deep-learning (DL)-based SCA-targeting parallelized implementations of PQKE protocols, namely, Frodo and NewHope with data augmentation techniques. Specifically, we explore approaches that convert 1-D time-series power measurement data into 2-D images to formulate SCA an image recognition task. The results show our attack's superiority over conventional techniques including horizontal differential power analysis (DPA), template attacks (TAs), and straightforward DL approaches. We demonstrate improvements up to 1.5× to recover a 100% success rate compared to DL with 1-D input data while using fewer data. We furthermore show that machine learning improves the results up to 1.25× compared to TAs. Furthermore, we perform cross-device attacks that obtain profiles from a single device, which has never been explored. Our 2-D approach is especially favored in this setting, improving the success rate of attacking Frodo from 20% to 99% compared to the 1-D approach. Our work thus urges countermeasures even on parallel architectures and single-trace attacks.},

In the big data era, classical machine learning has been applied to train IDS. However, classical IDS tend to be complex: either using several hidden layers susceptible to over-fitting on training data or using overly complex architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long-short term memory systems (LSTMs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This paper explored the combination of principles of quantum mechanics and neural networks to train IDS. A hybrid classical-quantum neural architecture is proposed with a quantum-assisted activation function that successfully captures patterns in the dataset while having less architectural memory footprint than classical solutions. The experimental results are demonstrated on the popular KDD99 dataset while comparing our solution to other classical models.},

  abstract = {The exponential growth of big data and deep learning has increased the data exchange traffic in society. Machine Learning as a Service, (MLaaS) which leverages deep learning techniques for predictive analytics to enhance decision-making, has become a hot commodity. However, the adoption of MLaaS introduces data privacy challenges for data owners and security challenges for deep learning model owners. Data owners are concerned about the safety and privacy of their data on MLaaS platforms, while MLaaS platform owners worry that their models could be stolen by adversaries who pose as clients. Consequently, Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) arises as a possible solution to this problem. Recently, several papers about PPDL for MLaaS have been published. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has summarized the existing literature on PPDL and its specific applicability to the MLaaS environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of privacy-preserving techniques, starting from classical privacy-preserving techniques to well-known deep learning techniques. Additionally, we present a detailed description of PPDL and address the issue of using PPDL for MLaaS. Furthermore, we undertake detailed comparisons between state-of-the-art PPDL methods. Subsequently, we classify an adversarial model on PPDL by highlighting possible PPDL attacks and their potential solutions. Ultimately, our paper serves as a single point of reference for detailed knowledge on PPDL and its applicability to MLaaS environments for both new and experienced researchers.},

RBM training can be performed using contrastive divergence (CD) and quantum annealing (QA). QA-based RBM training is fundamentally different from CD and requires samples from a quantum computer. We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a RBM using QA for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical classification problems to QA-based techniques. Further, we show that synthetic data generated from a RBM can be used to balance the original dataset.},

It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We conduct an in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses demonstrate a high correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation maps, and the input Mel-spectrogram. We provide an implementation1 for future studies.},

In this paper, we develop a predictive machine learning (ML) analysis to investigate the impact of deterministic classical noise in different stages of an optical continuous variable QRNG. Our ML model successfully detects inherent correlations when the deterministic noise sources are prominent. After appropriate filtering and randomness extraction processes are introduced, our QRNG system, in turn, demonstrates its robustness against ML. We further demonstrate the robustness of our ML approach by applying it to uniformly distributed random numbers from the QRNG and a congruential RNG. Hence, our result shows that ML has potentials in benchmarking the quality of RNG devices.},

However, the success of this field, as seen over the past decade, has resulted in the complexity of modern methodologies scaling exponentially, commonly requiring millions of parameters. Quantum computing (QC) is an active area of research aimed toward greatly reducing problems of complexity faced in classical computing. With growing interest toward quantum machine learning (QML) for applications of image classification, many proposed algorithms require usage of numerous qubits. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, these circuits may not always be feasible to execute effectively; therefore, we should aim to use each qubit as effectively and efficiently as possible, before adding additional qubits. This article proposes a new single-qubit-based deep quantum neural network for image classification that mimics traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques, resulting in a reduced number of parameters compared with previous works. Our aim is to prove the concept of the initial proposal by demonstrating classification performance of the single-qubit-based architecture, as well as to provide a tested foundation for further development. To demonstrate this, our experiments were conducted using various datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and ORL face datasets. To further our proposal in the context of the NISQ era, our experiments were intentionally conducted in noisy simulation environments. Initial test results appear promising, with classification accuracies of 94.6%, 89.5%, and 82.5% achieved on the subsets of MNIST, FMNIST, and ORL face datasets, respectively. In addition, proposals for further investigation and development were considered, where it is hoped that these initial results can be improved.},

  abstract = {The recent advances in mobile technologies have resulted in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices becoming more pervasive and integrated into our daily lives. The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.},

Several MQKA protocols in the traveling mode have been proposed for higher key generation rates, which, however, are vulnerable to a collusive attack presented by Liu. In this paper, an analysis of Liu's collusive attacks on Cao et al.'s protocol is given, based on which an efficient MQKA protocol that requires only sequential communication of a single d-level quantum system is put forward. Because of the single d-level quantum system, our protocol has huge advantages in scalability and can be realized with the state-of-the-art technology. The scalability means that each additional participant is only required to perform a unitary operator that is comparatively simple, and the complexity of measurements remains independent of the number of participants. Our protocol can also resist Liu's collusive attacks due to the encrypted quantum channel and has an efficiency rate of 1/2N(N is the number of participants) that is much better than those of other quantum key agreement protocols. In addition, by using the proposed encoding method, a wide class of problems for which quantum information protocols based on multisystem entanglement can be mapped into much simpler ones involving only one system.},

  abstract  = {We propose a strong physical unclonable function (PUF) provably secure against machine learning (ML) attacks with both classical and quantum computers. Its security is derived from cryptographic hardness of learning decryption functions of public-key cryptosystems. Our design compactly realizes the decryption function of the learning-with-errors (LWE) cryptosystem. Due to the fundamental connection of LWE to lattice problems, we call the construction the lattice PUF. Lattice PUF is constructed using a physically obfuscated key (POK), an LWE decryption function block, and a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) as a pseudo-random number generator. The POK provides the secret key of the LWE decryption function; its stability is ensured by a fuzzy extractor (FE). To reduce the challenge size, we exploit distributional relaxations of space-efficient LWEs. That allows only a small challenge-seed to be transmitted with the full-length challenge generated by the LFSR, resulting in a 100X reduction of communication cost. To prevent an active challenge-manipulation attack, a self-incrementing counter is embedded into the challenge seed. We prototyped the lattice PUF with 2136 challenge-response pairs (CRPs) on a Spartan 6 FPGA, which required 45 slices for the PUF logic proper and 233 slices for the FE. Simulation-based evaluation shows the mean (std) of uniformity to be 49.98 % (1. 58%), of uniqueness to be 50.00 % (1. 58%), and of reliability to be 1. 26% (2. 88%). The LWE concrete hardness estimator guarantees that a successful ML attack of the lattice PUF will require the infeasible 2128 CPU operations. Several classes of empirical ML attacks, including support vector machine, logistic regression, and deep neural networks, are used: in all attacks, the prediction error remains above 49.76% after 1 million training CRPs.},

Intrusion detection is an active network security defense measure, which is an attempt to invade, an ongoing intrusion or an intrusion that has occurred to identify the process. At present, the detection rate of intrusion detection method is low, the false alarm rate and false alarm rate is high, and the real-time performance is poor. It needs a large number of or complete data to achieve better detection performance. In this paper, the concept, characteristics, classification, research contents and difficulties of traditional intrusion detection for mass multimedia data transmission network are described. Then, the basic principle of neural network and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the basic idea of particle swarm optimization algorithm with quantum (QPSO) behaviour are introduced. It is emphasized that QPSO has better convergence performance than PSO algorithm in global optimization problems. In this paper, the concept, characteristics and structure of neural network are described, and the algorithm and classification of wavelet neural network are introduced. Then taking wavelet neural network (WNN) as the object, using the QPSO algorithm as the training algorithm, the concrete operation process is given. The research work in this paper shows that the performance of neural network trained by QPSO algorithm and improved QPSO algorithm is better than that of other intelligent algorithms such as PSO algorithm and genetic algorithm, and the convergence speed is faster than that of PSO algorithm or GA algorithm. QPSO is a high performance neural network training algorithm, which can play a good role in neural network anomaly detection.},

One key approach to preserving privacy for DDL is the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE), which allows computation on ciphertexts without decryption. Although current applications of HE provide some level of privacy to DDL, they are not post-quantum resistant and multi-key compliant. The use of same key by all participants could lead to collusion attacks and possible leakage of sensitive information from a participant's local dataset in the distributed deep learning setting. Furthermore, most of the privacy solutions provided for the DDL assume that all learning participants must be present before the start of the protocol. Hence, such solutions do not allow a new participant to benefit from the utility of the joint learning of other participants, for which it was not present. To address the above problems, we propose a new privacy preserving solution for DDL that uses an LWE-based Multi-key approach. Our proposed privacy preserving DDL solution is multi-key compliant, post-quantum resistant and has an additional property of allowing a new participant to benefit from the utility of an already trained collaborative deep learning system. We prove that our privacy-preserving distributed deep learning system is secured. We note that our proposed solution generally provides a robust privacy-preserving solution for the DDL and at the same time has great potential to reduce communication and computation costs associated with similar systems.},

This hybrid mode is devised to employ the fast processing speed of the symmetric key while circumventing the difficulty of providing services due to computational complexity of the asymmetric key method by limiting its use to secured key exchange. To implement a secured symmetric key-based cryptographic system to circumvent the crack problem due to the emergence of quantum computers in asymmetric key exchanges, the problem of sharing a key transferred in the most secure manner should be solved while symmetric keys in use are kept up-to-date. This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) cube algorithm that can be used by creating the up-to-date key in a symmetric key encryption system to provide security resistance in a quantum computer environment. More specifically, it presents a solution to the secured key sharing method that can minimize the damage due to the pre-shared key (PSK) leakage. This is done by using the method of inducing the symmetric key creation based on deep neural network learning without sharing the PSK between systems to securely maintain the key while creating and using the key that is variably used through the symmetric key encryption system of the 3D cube algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm secures confidentiality and integrity of data transferred over a network because information that can be obtained by malicious attackers is small (because the symmetric key used in encryption and decryption is induced without exchanging the PSK with the application of deep neural network learning).},

The research on power side-channels have so far predominantly focused on analyzing implementations of ciphers such as AES, DES, RSA, and recently post-quantum cryptography primitives (e.g., lattices). Meanwhile, machine-learning applications are becoming ubiquitous with several scenarios where the Machine Learning Models are Intellectual Properties requiring confidentiality. Expanding side-channel analysis to Machine Learning Model extraction, however, is largely unexplored. This paper expands the DPA framework to neural-network classifiers. First, it shows DPA attacks during inference to extract the secret model parameters such as weights and biases of a neural network. Second, it proposes the first countermeasures against these attacks by augmenting masking. The resulting design uses novel masked components such as masked adder trees for fully-connected layers and masked Rectifier Linear Units for activation functions. On a SAKURA-X FPGA board, experiments show that the first-order DPA attacks on the unprotected implementation can succeed with only 200 traces and our protection respectively increases the latency and area-cost by 2.8× and 2.3×.},

  abstract = {Hydrofluoroether (HFE) impurities detection is an issue related to detecting chemical contamination within a high volume manufacturing (HVM) chiller caused by a rapid emulated environmental attack. The aftereffects of the cycle emulated attack may eventually create a micro-crack in the heat-exchanger. This event eventually causes the contamination of HFE due to multiple chemical interactions. This study proposes a new classification methodology to detect HFE chemical impurities using induction by a 532nm laser. The purpose of the laser induction is to leverage its laser speckle contrast attributes and amplify its detection. One of the reasons for choosing the 532nm laser spectrum is its highest quantum efficiency. Once amplification of detection is achieved, the detector tends to be in a highly sensitive mode due to low marginality to differentiate between two different conditions. This mode is prone to be stochastic. Thus, a new form of architecture known as Deep Learning Laser Speckle Contrast Evolving Spiking Neural Network (DL-LSC-ESNN) is proposed. The architecture utilizes speckle contrast domain conversion, dimensional additivity of the receptive neuron of evolving spiking neural network (ESNN), followed by the strength of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction (FE) capability. Ultimately, the evolving and adaptive ability of ESNN is assimilated and integrated seamlessly. CNN acted to extract only an important spike train, and the result is its essences of important spikes or spike feature maps. The spike feature maps are then fed into the ESNN neuron repository, which either assimilates or creates a new neuron repository. The proposed methods show significant improvement in the accuracy of detection against multiple baseline state of the art CNN architecture and ultimately demonstrated its capability to detect real-time contamination of HFE thus improved the detection rate significantly for the HVM environment.},

In this article, a sparse cross attention (SCA) based transformer detector (SCATD) is developed for detecting foreign objects in OPSs. Specifically, a two-stage refinement architecture is proposed for extracting the features of foreign objects in OPS images. In the first stage, a spatiotemporal enhanced (STE)-convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to leverage feature-level spatiotemporal coherence across frames to emphasize the spatial responses of foreign objects. Then, a spatial memory (SM) based feature aggregation (SMFA) module is constructed to iteratively update the feature affinities during training. Moreover, the SCA network sparsely builds different weak transformer detectors to produce weak predictive results. All the predictive results are fused to achieve the better predictive performance via voting schemes in an adaptive way. Finally, our SCATD is compared with state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection algorithms. Experiments on real OPS dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed SCATD scheme in detecting foreign instances in OPSs.},

However, the present communication technologies have several security related issues which is required to provide secure end to end connectivity among services. Moreover, due to recent, rapid growth of quantum technologies, most common security mechanisms considered secure today may be soon imperilled. Thus, the modern security mechanisms during their construction also require the power of quantum technologies to resist various potential attacks from quantum computers. Because of its characteristics, quantum walks (QW) is considered as a universal quantum computation paradigm that can be accepted as an excellent key generator. In this regard, in this paper a new lightweight image encryption scheme based on QW for secure data transfer in the internet of things platforms and wireless networking with edge computing is proposed. The introduced approach utilises the power of nonlinear dynamic behaviour of QW to construct permutation boxes and generates pseudo-random numbers for encrypting the plain image after dividing it into blocks. The results of the conducted simulation and numerical analyses confirm that the presented encryption algorithm is effective. The encrypted images have randomness properties, no useful data about the ciphered image can be obtained via analysing the correlation of adjacent pixels. Moreover, the entropy value is close to 8, the number of the pixel change rate is greater than 99.61%, and there is high sensitivity of the key parameters with large key space to resist various attacks.},

Attackers install malware into a PLC's existing control logic to either modify the behavior continuously or wait for specific triggers. We consider Ladder Logic Bombs (LLBs) which are an extension of attacks like Stuxnet. These include stealthy LLBs, which are difficult to discover by humans manually evaluating PLC programs. We propose a monitoring technology for PLC's via Hybrid Quantum-Classical modelling of electromagnetic emissions from the Programmable Logic Controllers even in the case of stealthy LLBs.

We investigated various different types of ladder logic bomb activation, triggering modes, and payloads and discovered that our hybrid classical-quantum deep learning model can operate decoupled from the network and is very accurate at detecting logic layer vulnerabilities and faults.},

Such an attack can easily succeed by the existing white-box attack methods, where the perturbation is calculated based on the gradient of the target network. Unfortunately, the gradient is often unavailable in the real-world scenarios, which makes the black-box adversarial attack problems practical and challenging. In fact, they can be formulated as high-dimensional black-box optimization problems at the pixel level. Although evolutionary algorithms are well known for solving black-box optimization problems, they cannot efficiently deal with the high-dimensional decision space. Therefore, we propose an approximated gradient sign method using differential evolution (DE) for solving black-box adversarial attack problems. Unlike most existing methods, it is novel that the proposed method searches the gradient sign rather than the perturbation by a DE algorithm. Also, we transform the pixel-based decision space into a dimension-reduced decision space by combining the pixel differences from the input image to neighbor images, and two different techniques for selecting neighbor images are introduced to build the transferred decision space. In addition, six variants of the proposed method are designed according to the different neighborhood selection and optimization search strategies. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with a number of the state-of-the-art adversarial attack algorithms on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method shows superior performance for solving black-box adversarial attack problems, especially nontargeted attack problems.},

However, the occurrence of fatigue failure following an extended period of operation invariably results in a catastrophic failure. As a result, monitoring and diagnosing induction motors is critical to avoiding unplanned shutdowns caused by premature failures. This article aims to develop an effective method for motor fault detection using time–frequency contents of vibration signals and an attention-based convolutional neural network model. First, the vibration signals are collected and labeled into five different categories: normal condition, outer ring fault, inner ring fault, misalignment condition, and broken rotor bar. Then, using the Morlet function, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) converts the vibratory time-series signals to the scalogram feature images. The time–frequency feature images are created after downsampling and converting the measured vibration signals to the frequency domain. These images are then resized and fed into the proposed convolutional attention neural network (CANN) to identify various induction motor failures. The experimental results demonstrate that the suggested model can provide an excellent diagnosis accuracy of 99.43%, significantly better than the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for fault diagnosis. Moreover, the developed model’s robustness is validated against adversarial attacks based on the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) by including white Gaussian noise.},

However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.},

This paper presents a novel concept to conceal cryptographic keys into deep neural networks (DNNs), named DNNs-based key concealment scheme. In this scheme, a key can be concealed into a proper deep neural network model which is trained with secret input data. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our concept by presenting an instance and a use-case scenario of the DNNs-based key concealment scheme and show its correctness.

One of such vulnerabilities, namely, a backdoor attack is studied in this paper. A backdoor attacked neural network involves inducing unique misclassification rules or patterns as triggers in the neural network such that, upon encountering the trigger, the neural network will only predict the output based upon the misclassification rules, giving the attacker control over the output of the neural network. To prevent such a vulnerability, we propose to employ homomorphic encryption as a solution. Homomorphic Encrypted Data has a special property where certain operations can be performed on encrypted data to in-turn directly perform the operations on the plain-text data itself, without the need of any special mechanism. This ability of homomorphic encryption can be used in conjunction with the vulnerable neural network, to revoke the control of the attacker from the neural network. Thereby, in this paper, we will be securing a vulnerable neural network from backdoor attack using homomorphic encryption.},

However, it is intractable to solve the optimization problem related to the minimum adversarial distortion for general neural network cause it is non-convex. Works have studied the lower bound or upper bound of the minimum adversarial distortion to give a robustness metrics for neural networks, such as CLEVER score and CW attack. In this paper, we provide a formal robustness guarantee to transform the robustness analysis into two sub-problems: (1), compute out the maximum of the objective function gt* (rt); (2), generate a sequence {rth} s.t. limn→∞ rth is the minimum adversarial distortion for targeted attack. Based on this transformation, we propose an efficient and effective algorithm to directly estimate the instance-specific minimum adversarial distortion on the norm of the input manipulation required to change the classifier decision. Experimental results on two data-sets, MNIST and CIFAR, show that our measure of robustness is between the lower bound given by CLEVER and the upper bound by CW, indicating our approach gives a precise measure of the robustness of neural network. In addition, the powerful mathematical technique Extreme Value Estimation enables our algorithm computationally feasible for large neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first attack-independent approach to directly evaluate the minimum adversarial distortion as a robustness metric for neural network.},

The ease with which a user could interact was the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) of a sales team. Human Computer Interactions have many underlying parameters like Data Visualization and Presentation as some to deal with. With the race, on for better and faster presentations, evolved many frameworks to be widely used by all software developers. As the need grew for user friendly applications, more and more software professionals were lured into the front-end sophistication domain. Application frameworks have evolved to such an extent that with just a few clicks and feeding values as per requirements we are able to produce a commercially usable application in a few minutes. These frameworks generate quantum lines of codes in minutes which leaves a contrail of bugs to be discovered in the future. We have also succumbed to the benchmarking in Software Quality Metrics and have made ourselves comfortable with buggy software's to be rectified in future. The exponential evolution in the cyber domain has also attracted attackers equally. Average human awareness and knowledge has also improved in the cyber domain due to the prolonged exposure to technology for over three decades. As the attack sophistication grows and zero day attacks become more popular than ever, the suffering end users only receive remedial measures in spite of the latest Antivirus, Intrusion Detection and Protection Systems installed. We designed a software to display the complete services and applications running in users Operating System in the easiest perceivable manner aided by Computer Graphics and Data Visualization techniques.

  abstract = {Many data mining tasks rely on graphs to model relational structures among individuals (nodes). Since relational data are often sensitive, there is an urgent need to evaluate the privacy risks in graph data. One famous privacy attack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims to infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy concerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model inversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack performance. This is mainly due to the failure to consider the unique properties of graphs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study on model inversion attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), one of the state-of-the-art graph analysis tools in this paper. Firstly, in the white-box setting where the attacker has full access to the target GNN model, we present GraphMI to infer the private training graph data. Specifically in GraphMI, a projected gradient module is proposed to tackle the discreteness of graph edges and preserve the sparsity and smoothness of graph features; a graph auto-encoder module is used to efficiently exploit graph topology, node attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference; a random sampling module can finally sample discrete edges. Furthermore, in the hard-label black-box setting where the attacker can only query the GNN API and receive the classification results, we propose two methods based on gradient estimation and reinforcement learning (RL-GraphMI). With the proposed methods, we study the connection between model inversion risk and edge influence and show that edges with greater influence are more likely to be recovered. Extensive experiments over several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We also evaluate our attacks under two defenses: one is the well-designed differential private training, and the other is graph preprocessing. Our experimental results show that such defenses are not sufficiently effective and call for more advanced defenses against privacy attacks.},

It is fundamental that all users send out and receive information intended only for them with cybersecurity best practices guarding their information at all times. A substantial aspect of cybersecurity is data protection which is brought to life via encryption. Encryption protects private information and sensitive data and is essential to everyday communication on the Internet. Steganography and Cryptography are important methods that are used to enhance the process of encryption. While effective, encryption is dependent on keys which if compromised can lead to data getting in unauthorised hands and potentially getting misused. Additionally, with the advent of quantum technologies there is a conversation around the possibility of quantum algorithms being able to break through the highest forms of encryption. This has inspired the research on using neural networks to implement data protection which can effectively protect data without a dependency on keys. This paper aims to research and compare various techniques of performing data protection using image steganography through encoder-decoder architectures which are a special type of neural networks and to identify aspects from reviewed papers that will form basis for implementation of the same.},

In this article, we examine the case of Box-Cox transformation when assumptions of a regression model are violated. Specifically, we construct and compute a set of summary statistics and transformed the maximum likelihood computation into a per-role operational fashion. The innovative algorithms reduced the big data machine learning problem into a stream based small data learning problem. Once the Box-Cox information array is obtained, the optimal power transformation as well as the corresponding estimates of model parameters can be quickly computed. To evaluate the performance, we implemented the proposed Box-Cox algorithms on QCT developer cloud. Our results showed that by leveraging both the algorithms and the QCT cloud technology, find the fittest model from 101 potential parameters is much faster than the conventional approach.},

Its application to ECG biometric recognition has received increasing interest but is also accompanied by several deficiencies. In this study, we focus on applying DL, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to ECG biometric identification to address these deficiencies. Using prestored user-specific feature vectors, the proposed scheme can exclude unregistered subjects to realize ``open-set'' identification. With the help of its scalable structure and ``transfer learning,'' new subjects can be enrolled in an existing system without the need for storing the ECGs of those previously enrolled. Finally, schemes based on the quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) are presented to prune unnecessary filters in the proposed CNN model. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated using the ECGs of 285 subjects from the PTB dataset. The experimental results demonstrate an identification rate of more than 99% in closed-set identification. Although incorporating the proposed method for unregistered subject exclusion degraded the identification performance slightly, the ability of the approach to resist a dictionary attack was evident. Finally, using the QEA-based filter pruning method and its two-stage extension reduced the number of floating-point operations required to complete one identity recognition to 1.20% and 0.22% of the original value without significantly impacting the identification accuracy.},

They are designed to mislead CNNs to output incorrect results. Many methods are proposed to detect adversarial examples. Unfortunately, most detection-based defense methods are vulnerable to second-round adversarial attacks, which can simultaneously deceive the base model and the detector. To resist such second-round adversarial attacks, handcrafted steganalysis features are introduced to detect adversarial examples, while such a method receives low accuracy at detecting sparse perturbations. In this paper, we propose to combine handcrafted features with deep features via a fusion scheme to increase the detection accuracy and defend against second-round adversarial attacks. To avoid deep features being overwhelmed by high-dimensional handcrafted features, we propose an expansion-then-reduction process to compress the dimensionality of handcrafted features. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial example detection methods and remains robust under various second-round adversarial attacks.},

However, these methods cannot perceive the discriminative parts of an image. Therefore, we introduce a multigrained attention module into encoder-decoder network to fuse infrared and visible images (MgAN-Fuse). The infrared and visible images are encoded by two independent encoder networks due to their diverse modalities. Then, the results of the two encoders are concatenated to calculate the fused result by the decoder. To exploit the features of multiscale layers fully and force the model focus on the discriminative regions, we integrate attention modules into multiscale layers of the encoder to obtain multigrained attention maps, and then, the multigrained attention maps are concatenated with the corresponding multiscale features of the decoder network. Thus, the proposed method can preserve the foreground target information of the infrared image and capture the context information of the visible image. Furthermore, we design an additional feature loss in the training process to preserve the important features of the visible image, and a dual adversarial architecture is employed to help the model capture enough infrared intensity information and visible details simultaneously. The ablation studies illustrate the validity of the multigrained attention network and feature loss function. Extensive experiments on two infrared and visible image data sets demonstrate that the proposed MgAN-Fuse has a better performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

This system adapts several distance-based methods (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean, Neighbour-Joining, Fitch-Margoliash) into a private setting where the sequences owned by each party are not disclosed to the other members present in the protocol. We theoretically evaluate the performance and privacy guarantees of the system through a complexity analysis and security proof and give an extensive explanation about the implementation details and cryptographic protocols.

This demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality. We benchmark this implementation against a classical-only solution and we conclude that both approaches render similar execution times, the only difference being the time overhead taken by the oblivious key management system of the quantum-assisted approach.},

We demonstrate that specially chosen ciphertexts allow an adversary to modulate the leakage of a target device and enable full key extraction with a small number of traces through simple power analysis. Compared to prior research, our techniques require fewer traces and avoid building complex templates. We practically evaluate our methods using both a reference implementation and the ARM-specific implementation in pqm4 library. For the reference implementation, we target the leakage of the output of the inverse NTT computation and recover the full key with only four traces. For the pqm4 implementation, we develop a message-recovery attack that leads to extraction of the full secret key with between eight and 960 traces, depending on the compiler optimization level. We discuss the relevance of our findings to other lattice-based schemes and explore potential countermeasures.},

A novel super learner ensemble for one-class classification is developed, using overlapping rolling windows with stratified, $k$ -fold, $n$ -repeat cross-validation applied to each base learner followed by majority voting to derive the best learner. Our approach is demonstrated on a liquid distribution sensor data set. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique achieves an overall $F1$ -score of 99.13%, an anomalous recall score of 99% detecting anomalies lasting only 17 s. The key strength of the framework is the low computational complexity and error rate. The framework is modular, generic, applicable to other ICS, and transferable to other smart city sectors.},

  abstract = {As a lightweight hardware security primitive, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can provide reliable identity authentication for devices of Internet of Things (IoTs) with limited resources. However, the delay-based PUF structures in authentication protocols have static responding behaviors, which make them vulnerable to modeling attacks. To address this issue, many complex PUF designs have been designed to increase the nonlinearity of their models. However, most of them can still be broken by modeling-based machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a dynamic responding mechanism for PUF designs to generate dynamic responses is proposed. Different from the concept of logically reconfigurable PUFs, the proposed mechanism does not rely on external inputs to provide reconfiguration signals. And different from the conventional PUF authentication protocols that use large-size linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to extend the master challenge, the proposed scheme uses internally generated dynamic signals to obfuscate the master challenge to generate multiple subchallenges. These subchallenges are then input to the underlying strong PUF to generate multibit dynamic responses. It can prevent an attacker from obtaining valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs) for the underlying PUF. A security authentication protocol is also proposed, the special authentication bit-string design can resist both conventional ML attacks and the latest covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies (CMA-ES) variant.},

However, these primitives have to be realized in conventional hardware, which may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Therefore, vulnerability analysis of these primitives is essential before deployment. In this paper, a NIST favoured digital signature primitive- SPHINCS is taken for analysis. ChaCha and BLAKE are ciphers that form the building blocks of SPHINCS. These ciphers are based on Addition, Rotation, and XOR(ARX) operations. The literature review has shown ARX ciphers to be vulnerable against implementation attacks. In this work, an effective countermeasure for the aforementioned building blocks is explored. This is achieved through the following: Parallel Prefix Adders are taken for addition operation in these ciphers instead of the native adder in Electronic Design Automation(EDA) tools. Distinct profiles are created which include the cipher using a particular adder with its best-suited implementation style. An optimized version of Threshold Implementation(TI) is adopted on the profiles as a countermeasure for the attacks on the unprotected implementations. Finally, we evaluate the protected profiles' resistance using Test Vector Leakage Assessment(TVLA) and Deep learning techniques. Such an analysis that follows a generic framework will be straightforward to automate. We believe this will serve to be useful for standardization of Threshold Schemes.},

Reference timestamps broadcast by Global Navigation Satellite Systems of various countries have found wide application in synchronization systems for the generation and transmission of cryptographic keys. Signals from these systems are susceptible to spoofing and jamming attacks, which have been implemented in practice by various researchers. Therefore, it is proposed to use digital television channels as an alternative channel for transmitting timestamps. The process of synchronization using signals from digital television channels is understudied.This paper presents an algorithm for extracting reference timestamps from the wavelet spectrum of an image broadcast on digital television channels. The algorithm is based on the selection of the vector of wavelet coefficients of the video signal fragment corresponding to the timestamp. The procedure for extracting the wavelet spectrum of the timestamp is carried out using a multilayer neural network. Timestamps are used to temporally synchronize the process of generating secret keys by a quantum random number generator.},

Recently, deep models including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have been widely used to predict RUL. However, these models generally require sufficient labeled training data to guarantee fair performance, whereas a limited amount of labeled data overwhelmed by the abundance of unlabeled ones is the normality in industry, and the cost of full data annotation can be unaffordable. To attack this challenge, domain adaptation seeks to transfer the knowledge from a well-labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain by mitigating their domain gap. In this article, we leverage domain adaptation for RUL prediction and propose a novel method by aligning distributions at both the feature level and the semantic level. The proposed method facilitates a large improvement of model performance and faster convergence. Besides, we propose to use the transformer as the backbone, which can capture long-term dependency more efficiently than the widely used recurrent neural network (RNN), and is thus critical for boosting the robustness of the model. We test our model on the commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (CMAPSS) dataset and its newly published variant new CMAPSS (N-CMAPSS) provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), achieving state-of-the-art results on both source-only RUL prediction and domain adaptive RUL prediction tasks.},

This contribution investigates the dynamics of a 2-D trigonometric map designed using some well-known maps: Logistic-sine-cosine maps. Stability analysis reveals that the map has an infinite number of solutions. Lyapunov exponent, bifurcation diagram, and phase portrait are used to demonstrate the complex dynamic of the map. The sequences of the map are utilized to construct a robust cryptosystem. First, three sets of key streams are generated from the newly designed trigonometric map and are used jointly with the image components (R, G, B) for hamming distance calculation. The output distance-vector, corresponding to each component, is then Bit-XORed with each of the key streams. The output is saved for further processing. The decomposed components are again Bit-XORed with key streams to produce an output, which is then fed into the conditional shift algorithm. The Mandelbrot Set is used as the input to the conditional shift algorithm so that the algorithm efficiently applies confusion operation (complete shuffling of pixels). The resultant shuffled vectors are then Bit-XORed (Diffusion) with the saved outputs from the early stage, and eventually, the image vectors are combined to produce the encrypted image. Performance analyses of the proposed cryptosystem indicate high security and can be effectively incorporated in an IoHT framework for secure medical image transmission.},

However, these traditional cryptographic systems are bound to fail in the ensuing era of quantum computing. Thus, Artificial Intelligence (AI) inspired security methods are needed to secure communications in the era of quantum computing. This article presents a challenge-response password-based authentication system based on the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) AI hard problem. In this system, a server sends a challenge text to a client, then the client generates a random image and blends the challenge text inside this random image using his password. Then the client sends the generated image to the server. The server extracts the challenge text from the sent image using his copy of the client's password. If the extracted challenge text is the same as the sent challenge text, then both the client's and the server's copies of the password match and the client is authenticated. The efficiency of the proposed system is analyzed and the outcomes prove that the proposed system is efficient in terms of time and space. Also, a security investigation of the proposed system is employed, and the results prove that the system is probabilistic and very sensitive to changes in its parameters. It does not leak any statistical information about the client's password and the generated images cannot be distinguished from random images. In addition, the security of the proposed system is analyzed against two possible attacks; the brute force attack and the replay attack and the results prove that the proposed system is immune to these attacks. Finally, the proposed system is ensured to be indistinguishably secure against an adaptive chosen-challenge text attack (IND-ACCTA), based on the CAPTCHA AI hard problem when the hash function H is modeled as a random oracle.},

However, the recent advance in quantum computer has potentially crippled its security, as the traditional decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH)-based PRE is venerable to the quantum attack. Thus, learning with errors (LWE)-based PRE schemes, as a kind of latticebased construction with the inherent quantum-resistant property, has attracted special research interest. Unfortunately, the main drawback of lattice-based public key encryption scheme is noise management after multiplication evaluation. Many cryptographers have been devoted to controlling the expansion of noise. In this line of work, Dagdelen-Gajek-G̈opfert (DGG) put forth the notion of learning with errors in the exponent (LWEE) which is based on lattice and group-theoretic assumption, meanwhile demonstrated a paradigm for constructing efficient quantum resistance public key schemes. In this paper, on top of DGG, we construct a single-bit, single-hop and unidirectional LWEE- based PRE scheme with indistinguishable chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) security. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first LWEE-based PRE scheme.},

In order to resist known attacks for IoT networks, multiple security protocols must be established among nodes. Thus, IoT devices are required to execute various cryptographic operations, such as public key encryption/decryption. However, classic public key cryptosystems, such as Rivest-Shammir-Adlemon and elliptic curve cryptography are computationally more complex to be efficiently implemented on IoT devices and are vulnerable regarding quantum attacks. Therefore, after complete development of quantum computing, these cryptosystems will not be secure and practical. In this paper, we propose InvRBLWE, an optimized variant for binary learning with errors over the ring (Ring-LWE) scheme that is proven to be secure against quantum attacks and is highly efficient for hardware implementations. We propose two architectures for InvRBLWE: 1) a high-speed architecture targeting edge and powerful IoT devices and 2) an ultralightweight architecture, which can be implemented on resource-constrained nodes in IoT. The proposed architectures are scalable regarding security levels and we provide experimental results for two versions of the InvRBLWE scheme providing 84 and 190 bits of classic security. Our implementation results on field programmable gate array dominate the best of the classic and post-quantum previous implementations. Moreover, our two different application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations show improvement in terms of speed, area, power, and/or energy.

Most important of all, the quantitative analysis method of ROI parameters is given, and the optimal balance between encryption speed and encryption security performance is achieved by using game theory.

The popularity of video surveillance systems and growing use of facial images have increased the risk of leaking personal information. On the other hand, traditional cryptography systems are still expensive, time consuming, and low security, leading to be threatened by the foreseeable attacks of quantum computers. This paper proposes a novel approach to fully protect facial images extracted from videos based on a post-quantum cryptosystem named NewHope cryptography. Applying the proposed technique to arrange input data for encryption and decryption processes significantly reduces encryption and decryption times. The proposed facial security system was successfully accelerated using data-parallel computing model on the recently launched Nvidia GTX 2080Ti Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Average face frame extracted from video ($190\times 190$ pixel) required only $2.2~ms$ and $2.7~ms$ total encryption and decryption times with security parameters $n=1024$ and $n=2048$ , respectively, which is approximately 9 times faster than previous approaches. Analysis results of security criteria proved that the proposed system offered comparable confidentiality to previous systems.},

  abstract = {Certificateless signcryption can simultaneously provide certificateless signature and encryption. In recent years, many certificateless signcryption schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes are based on traditional mathematical theory and not have the ability of resisting the quantum computing attacks. Up to now, lattice-based certificateless signature or encryption schemes have been proposed; however, these schemes only have one function and cannot fulfill two functions of certificateless signature and encryption at the same time. In consideration of this reason, in this article, a certificateless signcryption scheme from lattice (L-CLSS) is constructed. L-CLSS has three advantages. First, in the random oracle model, it is provably indistinguishable against adaptive ciphertext-chosen attacks under the intractability of the learning with errors (LWE) problem and unforgeable against adaptive message-chosen attacks under the hardness of small integer solution (SIS) problem. Second, comparison with the cryptographic algorithms under the difficulty of large integer decomposition, L-CLSS can resist the quantum computing attacks. Third, L-CLSS has higher computation efficiency and a lower communication cost than the existing schemes.},

There are two important factors that should be considered in the progress: speed and security. Different algorithms are used to protect secure data between original sender and receiver by a system which uses public key and private key, and this is so-called as public key cryptosystem. In this paper, RSA algorithm and ECC algorithm are shown about their encryption and decryption and their advantages and disadvantages are compared. Elliptic curve cryptography has recently attracted much attention. The benefit of ECC compared to RSA is that it provides the same security but with smaller bit sizes, thus less processing overhead. The encryption and decryption algorithm which is utilized to encrypt and decrypt the video gives the video files more and more security and the most common one is elliptic curve algorithm, which are used to develop schemes such as key exchange and digital signature. However, since the mathematical background of ECC is not as easy as other cryptosystems, as in geometry, abstract algebraic, number theory, it is hard to choose a good curve. Therefore, finally, there are some suggestions to the drawbacks in RSA algorithm in its mechanism to help to reduce the attacks so that people won’t overwhelm reply to much on ECC. Suggestions are given according to the parameters involved in the algorithm and both RSA and ECC are preferred methods until the appearance of quantum computers.},

Among various PQC schemes, lattice-based cryptography (LBC) based on learning with error (LWE) has attracted much attention because of its performance efficiency and security guarantee. In LWE-based LBCs, the Module-LWE-based schemes gain advantage over the others benefiting from the unique polynomial matrix and vector structure. To provide a high-performance implementation of Module-LWE applications for the edge computing paradigm, we propose a domain-specific processor based on a matrix extension of RISC-V architecture. This custom extension encapsulates the matrix-based ring operations with a high-level functional abstraction. A 2-D systolic array with configurable functionality is proposed to perform matrix-based number theoretic transform (NTT) and other arithmetic operations, achieving high data-level parallelism with support for the variable-sized polynomial matrix and vector structure. As this structure of Module-LWE involves no data dependency between different inner elements, an out-of-order mechanism is further developed to exploit the instruction-level parallelism. We implement the proposed architecture under TSMC 28nm technology. The evaluation results show that our implementation can achieve up to $3.5\times $ and $3.3\times $ improvement in cycle count respectively in Kyber and Dilithium, compared to the state-of-the-art crypto-processor counterparts.},

  abstract  = {Key exchange protocols establish a secret key to confidentially communicate digital information over public channels. Lattice-based key exchange protocols are a promising alternative for next-generation applications due to their quantum-cryptanalysis resistance and implementation efficiency. While these constructions rely on the theory of quantum-resistant lattice problems, their practical implementations have shown vulnerability against side-channel attacks in the context of public-key encryption or digital signatures. Applying such attacks on key exchange protocols is, however, much more challenging because the secret key changes after each execution of the protocol, limiting the side-channel adversary to a single measurement. In this paper, we demonstrate the first successful power side-channel attack on lattice-based key exchange protocols. The attack targets the hardware implementation of matrix and polynomial multiplication used in these protocols. The crux of our idea is to apply a horizontal attack that makes hypothesis on several intermediate values within a single execution all relating to the same secret and to combine their correlations for accurately estimating the secret key. We illustrate that the design of key exchange protocols combined with the nature of lattice arithmetic enables our attack. Since a straightforward attack suffers from false positives, we demonstrate a novel procedure to recover the key by following the sequence of intermediate updates during multiplication. We analyzed two key exchange protocols, NewHope (USENIX'16) and Frodo (CCS'16), and show that their implementations can be vulnerable to our attack. We test the effectiveness of the proposed attack using concrete parameters of these protocols on a physical platform with real measurements. On a SAKURA-G FPGA Board, we show that the proposed attack can estimate the entire secret key from a single power measurement with over 99% success rate.},

Consequently, the research of physical layer security has attracted significant attentions recently. However, the RF fingerprint portability is an inevitable problem in practical applications. In this work, a joint RF feature calibration and weighted feature classification scheme is proposed to overcome the RF fingerprint portability problem caused by channel fading and receiver differentiation.

Four impulse radio ultrawideband transceivers are placed in a specific geometry and data fusion is performed to reduce the influence of multipath and noise on the detection process. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to extract the patterns corresponding to a moving machine and humans and classify them accordingly.

Two key lessons learned are as follows. First, other than inheriting vulnerabilities from the previous generations, 6G has new threat vectors from new radio technologies, such as the exposed location of radio stripes in ultra-massive MIMO systems at Terahertz bands and attacks against pervasive intelligence. Second, physical layer protection, deep network slicing, quantum-safe communications, artificial intelligence (AI) security, platform-agnostic security, real-time adaptive security, and novel data protection mechanisms such as distributed ledgers and differential privacy are the top promising techniques to mitigate the attack magnitude and personal data breaches substantially.},

The flow of power between main grid and microgrid is monitored by smart meter, which kept the end user's privacy information and his/her energy usage in real time. Hence, ensuring the privacy and security of these information is a considerable challenge. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between microgrids and the main grid, and design a quantum-resistant lightweight authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol based on fog computing. The proposed protocol provides the mutual authentication and generates a session key between a smart meter and a fog node. More importantly, it can resist against quantum computing attacks, as the security of our scheme relies on the hardness of the learning parity with noise (LPN) problem, an NP-complete problem. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol and prove that our protocol is more lightweight and efficient.},

One direction of research consists in implementing those candidates on embedded systems and that exposes them to physical attacks in return. The Classic McEliece cryptosystem, which is among the four finalists of round 3 in the Key Encapsulation Mechanism category, builds its security on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem, which is a classic hard problem in code-based cryptography. This cryptosystem was recently targeted by a laser fault injection attack leading to message recovery. Regrettably, the attack setting is very restrictive and it does not tolerate any error in the faulty syndrome. Moreover, it depends on the very strong attacker model of laser fault injection, and does not apply to optimised implementations of the algorithm that make optimal usage of the machine words capacity. In this article, we propose a to change the angle and perform a message-recovery attack that relies on side-channel information only. We improve on the previously published work in several key aspects. First, we show that side-channel information, obtained with power consumption analysis, is sufficient to obtain an integer syndrome, as required by the attack framework. This is done by leveraging classic machine learning techniques that recover the Hamming weight information very accurately. Second, we put forward a computationally-efficient method, based on a simple dot product and information-set decoding algorithms, to recover the message from the, possibly inaccurate, recovered integer syndrome. Finally, we present a masking countermeasure against the proposed attack.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known vulnerable to adversarial attacks. That is, adversarial examples, obtained by adding delicately crafted distortions onto original legal inputs, can mislead a DNN to classify them as any target labels. This work provides a solution to hardening DNNs under adversarial attacks through defensive dropout. Besides using dropout during training for the best test accuracy, we propose to use dropout also at test time to achieve strong defense effects. We consider the problem of building robust DNNs as an attacker-defender two-player game, where the attacker and the defender know each others' strategies and try to optimize their own strategies towards an equilibrium. Based on the observations of the effect of test dropout rate on test accuracy and attack success rate, we propose a defensive dropout algorithm to determine an optimal test dropout rate given the neural network model and the attacker's strategy for generating adversarial examples. We also investigate the mechanism behind the outstanding defense effects achieved by the proposed defensive dropout. Comparing with stochastic activation pruning (SAP), another defense method through introducing randomness into the DNN model, we find that our defensive dropout achieves much larger variances of the gradients, which is the key for the improved defense effects (much lower attack success rate). For example, our defensive dropout can reduce the attack success rate from 100% to 13.89% under the currently strongest attack i.e., C&W attack on MNIST dataset.},

However, with an exponential increase in the usage of IoT technologies, we have been witnessing an increase in the number of cyber attacks on the IoT environment. An adversary can capture the private key shared between users and devices and can launch various attacks, such as IoT ransomware, Mirai botnet, man-in-the-middle, denial of service, chosen plaintext, and chosen ciphertext. To mitigate these security attacks on the IoT environment, the traditional public key cryptographic primitives are inadequate because of their high computational and communication costs. Therefore, lattice-based public-key cryptosystem (LB-PKC) is a promising technique for secure communication. We discuss the taxonomy of two major problems, namely, the shortest path and the closest path problems with respect to the applicability of lattice-based cryptographic primitives for IoT devices. Moreover, we also discuss various LB-PKC techniques, such as NTRU, learning with errors (LWEs), and ring-LWE (R-LWE) which are often used to solve shortest path and lattice NP-hard problems in a polynomial time. We further classify the R-LWE into three categories, namely identity-based encryption, homomorphic encryption, and secure authentication key exchange. We describe the operations and algorithms adopted in each of these encryption mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the challenges, open issues, and future directions for applying LB-PKC in the IoT environment.},

  abstract = {Since radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are easily cloned, tag anticounterfeit is an important issue for RFID security. Physical-layer identification is a feasible method for the anticounterfeit, and it introduces machine learning to train classification on tag physical-layer signals. However, there are still some problems further investigated for the method, such as features of tag and cross validation. For this, this article proposes a new learning method, which extracts time- and frequency-domain statistics not only from the raw tag responding signal but also from its expected, noise, and normalized signals and adopts feature selection to classify authentic and counterfeit tags. In addition, this article also proposes a new cross validation to objectively test the performance of the physical-layer method. This experiment uses a software-defined radio to collect data from 140 tags of seven classes from three manufacturers. The results show that the classification accuracy of this new method is 4%–5% higher than that of the traditional method. Besides, under the new cross validation, the classification accuracy of all the physical layer methods will drop by 8%–10%. From this, we get an important conclusion that the performance of the physical-layer methods will depend on whether a training set has attacking tag data.},

In recent years, there have been many studies focusing on maintaining participant privacy against honest-but-curious servers. In 2017, Google proposed a promising solution that applies double masking and secret sharing tools to protect participants’ gradients for each round of federated learning (CCS’17). However, this solution fails to achieve post-quantum security and costs high communication overhead to distribute secret shares. To address this problem, this work designs a lattice-based multi-use secret sharing scheme to avoid distributing new secret shares to all participants in each round of federated learning while achieving post-quantum security. In other words, this new tool allows each participant to update his secret shares locally while maintaining the privacy of participants’ gradients against quantum attacks. Finally, this work applies this new secret sharing technique to construct a lattice-based federated learning protocl LaF. The theoretic analysis demonstrates that LaF saves a lot of communication costs compared with Google’s solution, and the experimental results show that LaF achieves higher runtime efficiency.},

However, the security and efficiency of schemes based on LWE are closely affected by the error sampling algorithms. The existing pseudo-random sampling methods potentially have security leaks that can fundamentally influence the security levels of previous cryptographic primitives. Given that these primitives are proved semantically secure, directly deducing the influences caused by leaks of sampling algorithms may be difficult. Thus, we attempt to use the attack model based on automatic learning system to identify and evaluate the practical security level of a cryptographic primitive that is semantically proved secure in indistinguishable security models. In this paper, we first analyzed the existing major sampling algorithms in terms of their security and efficiency. Then, concentrating on the Indistinguishability under Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) security model, we realized the new attack model based on the automatic learning system. The experimental data demonstrates that the sampling algorithms perform a key role in LWE-based schemes with significant disturbance of the attack advantages, which may potentially compromise security considerably. Moreover, our attack model is achievable with acceptable time and memory costs.},

A novel unsupervised data-driven method for electricity theft detection in AMI is proposed in this article. The method incorporates observer meter data, wavelet-based feature extraction, and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. A new anomaly score is developed based on the degree of cluster membership information produced by FCM clustering to differentiate normal and fraudulent users. We perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of key components of the proposed method on the performance using a publicly available smart meter dataset. The results show that all key components of the proposed method contribute significantly to the performance improvement. The proposed method is compared with a set of baselines including state-of-the-art methods using smart meter data of both business users and residential users. The comparison results indicate that the proposed method achieves significantly better detection performance than all baseline methods. We also show that the proposed method maintains a good performance when the detection time frame is reduced from 30 to 20 days.},

AF can be diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG); however, continuous monitoring produces a large amount of data that can increase storage, power, and transmission bandwidth requirements. Compressive sensing has been used to mitigate increased requirements of continuous monitoring. An AF detector using a deterministic compressively sensed ECG is proposed. By detecting AF in the compressed domain, the computationally expensive process of reconstructing the ECG can be avoided. The detector was based on a random forest trained on features extracted using the wavelet transform, empirical mode decomposition, discrete cosine transform, and statistical methods. ECG data from the long-term AF Database available on PhysioNet were used. The performances of the detectors trained using features from compressed and uncompressed ECG were compared. Using the trained detector, the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and the weighted average precision (AP) were both 0.93 for uncompressed data using record-based tenfold cross validation. The AUC and AP were 0.91 and 0.90 at 50% compression, 0.92 and 0.91 at 75% compression, and 0.82 and 0.91 at 95% compression, respectively.},

  abstract = {The Multi-Key Fully Homomorphic Encryption (MKFHE) based on the NTRU cryptosystem is an important alternative to the post-quantum cryptography due to its simple scheme form, high efficiency, and fewer ciphertexts and keys. In 2012, Lopez-Alt et al. proposed the first NTRU-type MKFHE scheme, the LTV12 scheme, using the key-switching and modulus-reduction techniques, whose security relies on two assumptions: the Ring Learning With Error (RLWE) assumption and the Decisional Small Polynomial Ratio (DSPR) assumption. However, the LTV12 and subsequent NTRU-type schemes are restricted to the family of power-of-2 cyclotomic rings, which may affect the security in the case of subfield attacks. Moreover, the key-switching technique of the LTV12 scheme requires a circular application of evaluation keys, which causes rapid growth of the error and thus affects the circuit depth. In this paper, an NTRU-type MKFHE scheme over prime cyclotomic rings without key-switching is proposed, which has the potential to resist the subfield attack and decrease the error exponentially during the homomorphic evaluating process. First, based on the RLWE and DSPR assumptions over the prime cyclotomic rings, a detailed analysis of the factors affecting the error during the homomorphic evaluations in the LTV12 scheme is provided. Next, a Low Bit Discarded & Dimension Expansion of Ciphertexts (LBD&DEC) technique is proposed, and the inherent homomorphic multiplication decryption structure of the NTRU is proposed, which can eliminate the key-switching operation in the LTV12 scheme. Finally, a leveled NTRU-type MKFHE scheme is developed using the LBD&DEC and modulus-reduction techniques. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme compared to the LTV12 scheme can decrease the magnitude of the error exponentially and minimize the dimension of ciphertexts.},

This article proposes an electricity theft detector using metering data based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The metering data are preprocessed, including recover missing and erroneous values and normalization. The classification model based on XGBoost is trained using both benign and malicious samples. Simulations are done by using the Irish Smart Energy Trails data set with six certain attack types. Compared with the support vector machine, decision tree, and other eight machine learning methods, the proposed method can detect electricity theft with either higher accuracy or lower false-positive rate. Experiment results also demonstrate that the proposed method is robust when the data are imbalanced. Our codes are available at https://github.com/WenHe-Hnu/Electric_Theft_XGBoost.},

The 13th conference was completed in Ankara, Turkey, between December 3-4, 2020 via online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This conference aims to bring people from both academia and industry to share the latest advances in cyber security and cryptology, develop cooperation between university and industry, inform the public, and increase the public awareness of information security. This year, the main theme of the ISCTurkey 2020 Conference has been determined as "Cyber Security and Secure Data Sharing and Transfer." The increase in applications of Machine to Machine communication (M2M), the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain Technology, and Post-Quantum Cryptography drastically changes the nature of both cyber defense and cyber-attacks. New developments and changes in these fields within the framework of the definition of digital identity emerging are discussed at the conference. Besides, cyber-attacks and the measures to be taken against them are the conference's other topics.
