  abstract  = {In recent years, machine learning has penetrated a large part of our daily lives, which creates special challenges and impressive progress in this area. Nevertheless, as the amount of daily data is grown, learning time is increased. Quantum machine learning (QML) may speed up the processing of information and provide great promise in machine learning. However, it is not used in practice yet, because quantum software and hardware challenges are still unsurmountable. This paper provides current research of quantum computing and quantum machine learning algorithms. Also, the quantum vendors, their frameworks, and their platforms are presented. A few fully implemented versions of quantum machine learning are presented, which are easier to be evaluated. Finally, QML's challenges, and problems are discussed.},

One exciting avenue of quantum computing is quantum machine learning (QML) which can exploit the high dimensional Hilbert space to learn richer representations from limited data and thus can efficiently solve complex learning tasks. Despite the increased interest in QML, there have not been many studies that discuss the security aspects of QML. In this work, we explored the possible future applications of QML in the hardware security domain. We also expose the security vulnerabilities of QML and emerging attack models, and corresponding countermeasures.},

For this reason, an active research field is represented by malware detection, with a great effort in the development of deep learning models starting from a set of malicious and legitimate applications. The recent introduction of quantum computing made possible quantum machine learning i.e., the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a comparison between several deep learning models, by taking into account also a hybrid quantum malware detector. We explore the effectiveness of different architectures for malicious family detection in the Android environment: LeNet, AlexNet, a Convolutional Neural Network model designed by authors, VGG16 and a Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network i.e., a model where the first layer is a quantum convolution that uses transformations in circuits to simulate the behavior of a quantum computer. Experiments performed on a real-world dataset composed of 8446 Android malicious and legitimate applications allow us to compare the various models, with particular regard to the quantum model concerning the other ones.},

Federated learning (FL) and blockchain are emerging technologies that can assist in mitigating these challenges. FL-based anomaly detection is introduced to prevent road accidents with the help of blockchain. An environment is built to conduct experiments to prove the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The performance analysis demonstrates that our presented scheme outperforms the traditional scheme while having privacy concerns.},

We present Diolkos, a system that leverages smart switches to dynamically re-reroute data flows in response to drops in performance. In contrast to other techniques, our tool predicts the future throughput at each port in a switch if a data flow were to be sent through it, and updates which port should be taken to maximize throughput. We use several techniques to predict network switch performance on a software defined network (SDN) mimicking topologies commonly found in datacenters. Experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of choosing a port to send flows through based on predicted performance. We found that using a distributed predictive technique achieves a 24% improvement over using a traditional heuristic technique.},

Teleportation and entanglement swapping, two building blocks for the future quantum Internet, rely on secure classical bit communications. When lack of authenticity, integrity, and replay protection may have a high impact, quantum data communications are at risk and need to be protected. Building upon quantum cryptography and random generation of quantum operators, we propose a solution to protect the authenticity, integrity, and replay of quantum data communications. Our solution includes a classical data interface to quantum data cryptography. We describe how classical keying material can be mapped to quantum operators.

  abstract  = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces---user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, hand and body gestures, facial expressions, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces.This three-volume handbook is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This third volume focuses on state-of-the-art multimodal language and dialogue processing, including semantic integration of modalities. The development of increasingly expressive embodied agents and robots has become an active test-bed for coordinating multimodal dialogue input and output, including processing of language and nonverbal communication. In addition, major application areas are featured for commercializing multimodal-multisensor systems, including automotive, robotic, manufacturing, machine translation, banking, communications, and others. These systems rely heavily on software tools, data resources, and international standards to facilitate their development. For insights into the future, emerging multimodal-multisensor technology trends are highlighted for medicine, robotics, interaction with smart spaces, and similar topics. Finally, this volume discusses the societal impact of more widespread adoption of these systems, such as privacy risks and how to mitigate them. The handbook chapters provide a number of walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology and tutorial support for mastering this emerging field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces need to be equipped to most effectively advance human performance during the next decade.},
